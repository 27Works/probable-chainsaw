          "content": "<p>A nine-event season, a push to accommodate non-compliant engines, a renewed association with Radical UK that provides significant technical support, and an experienced hand at the helm will herald in a new era for the championship next season.</p>\n\n<p>“Our focus is very much around taking Radical Australia Cup to the next level,” Category Manager and the man tasked with taking the successful sportscar category forward, <strong>Karl Reindler explained</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>“It has enjoyed great success over the last ten years, but like any form of the sport in the modern era, you have to move with the market, and over the last six months we’ve been very careful to work with, and listen to our customers to determine our next step. On top of that, a reshuffle within management in the UK has provided a renewed push from the manufacturer, and they’ve been right behind our restructure,” Reindler added having visited the UK factory earlier in the year.</p>\n\n<p>Technically, the association between Radical UK and Radical Australia will see the factory provide greater support with both product and manpower, ensuring Radical Australia are able to provide both equipment that is up to date with current international category regulations whilst also supporting Australia in a technical role with CAMS during the Cup season next year, something the Series will enjoy for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>“At the same time, we need to find a way to ensure that as many of the 50 cars that are currently in Australia, are out on track competing,” Reindler explained.</p>\n\n<p>“Part of that is ensuring we work with teams that have Radicals with engines that aren’t compliant with Cup rules [all compliant engines in any Radical championship around the world, must have been checked and sealed by the authorised dealer to ensure consistency of the global category rules], to give them a way to be able to compete within the Cup next year, and we believe we have a great solution to that.</p>\n\n<p>“The calendar is also an important part of the program, and whilst we are finalising our 2019 calendar right now with CAMS [final dates will be set once the Supercars calendar is released] we expect to see events at Bathurst, Phillip Island, Sydney Motorsport Park and The Bend as a minimum with a six round Cup season scheduled with our two traditional 50-minute races each round, but there will be an additional jewel at the tail end of the season to add to that.”</p>\n\n<p>A three-race ‘Triple Crown’ with a big prize will be contested late in the season, adding to the outright prize of a round of a drive in the Radical Masters Series in Europe, a prize that has been won by drivers like Peter Paddon, Neale Muston and Tim Berryman in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Details of the season ending ‘Triple Crown’ will be revealed later in the year, well ahead of the 2019 season, but Radical Australia have confirmed it will be a more than attractive addition to the European drive offered to the 2019 Cup champion.</p>\n\n<p>From Reindler’s perspective, the new season looks positive, and the former Supercars regular admits that it needs to be.</p>\n\n<p>“After ten years you need to reassess and look into the future. The Series has had a terrific run to date, but it needs to reinvent itself and start to move forward again.</p>\n\n<p>“I still maintain that as a driver’s car, these things are fantastic, and Radical have proven time and time again, that bang for buck, it is one of the best categories in the world. The cars are fast, they’re reliable, their safe and they look fantastic, whilst they’re also identical all over the world, so the beautiful thing is, you can jump on a plane to the States or to Europe, jump behind the wheel of an SR3 there and the performance will be the same - and that’s something we’re also looking to exploit some more next year.”</p>\n\n<p>“Like Radical Australia, Radical UK have restructured to look at how we can better work with our customers and make the category more attractive for the future,” <strong>Nigel Land, Radical UK’s Marketing Director </strong>admitted.</p>\n\n<p>“We were in Australia earlier in the year to talk with Radical Australia, and offer our full support as they look to the next ten years, and we believe the program they have on offer is first class, and we will be behind them 100% as they embark on the new season.”</p>\n\n<p>For more information on Radical Australia or RA Motorsports, please contact Tahlia Nielson on 0428 625 888 or email; <a href=\"mailto:tahlia@radicalaustralia.com.au\">tahlia@radicalaustralia.com.au</a><br>\n#RadicalAustralia</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalaustralia.com.au/\">RADICAL AUSTRALIA CUP</a>"

          "content": "<p>Ahead of this weekend’s penultimate double-header round at Donington Park, two numbers separate title rivals James Pinkerton and Ryan Harper-Ellam in the battle for the overall championship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first is five – the number of victories in favour of Harper-Ellam after the last round at Cadwell Park. Heading to the Lincolnshire venue, points leader Pinkerton and Harper-Ellam – who won his race seat for this year by topping last year’s SR1 Cup Shootout contest – had an even share of the race wins across the first six rounds. But did Harper-Ellam’s double win on familiar turf at Cadwell signal a turning of the tide?</p>\n\n<p>That brings us to that second figure, 14 – Pinkerton’s now-trimmed points advantage ahead of this weekend’s double header at Donington Park. With 40 points awarded for a race win, the difference between the two is now so slight that a single slip up will surely be hugely costly.</p>\n\n<p>While the title fight surrounds the top two, the fight for third is also finely poised, and just so happens to involve two closely matched class rivals. Both Will Hunt and Chris Short are in their maiden year of racing the 1340cc 182bhp SR1s, and both are evenly matched in the battle for the Rookie Cup honours. Hunt currently sits third overall and top of the class title chase, but Short is only four points behind in the Rookie race.</p>\n\n<p>“Things are so close between Will and myself, and I’m really loving the competition,” says Short. “I’ve had two podium finishes so far this year – at Oulton Park and Cadwell Park – and that’s really boosted my confidence ahead of the final two rounds.</p>\n\n<p>“I’ve tested at Donington and it’s a wonderful place to handle the SR1 – it’s flat-out all the way down the Craner Curves and there are so many overtaking opportunities. It will undoubtedly be two exciting races. Will’s a very talented driver and has so far had the edge over me in qualifying, but each time I get in the car my confidence grows so I’ve had some great, close battles with him in the races.”</p>\n\n<p>Mark Williams sits fifth overall and is in a tight battle with Julian Lay and Gavin McAlpine. Lay also leads the Fangio Trophy category, which awards drivers who are aged 45 and over. David Tagg and Paul Clark are Lay’s biggest rival for the Fangio honours, and both are tied on points in second place, 28 behind Lay.</p>\n\n<p>This weekend’s grid is likely to swell to 16 cars with a few new additions, including a debut for Dean Warriner, who has previous racing experience in the Lotus UK Cup. Another newcomer is Andy Wilkins, who previously raced in the Renault Clio Cup and has now opted to give rear-wheel drive a go. Simon Anderson also joins as a rookie.</p>\n\n<p>Likely to mix it at the front is another new entry, Shane Stoney. A former Mini Challenge champion, Stoney brings recent experience from the Ginetta GT5 Challenge and will be one to watch.</p>\n\n<p>With just four races remaining this season, the fight for honours in all three classes is still wide open.</p>\n\n<p>SR1 Cup qualifying at Donington Park starts at 11:20 on Saturday, followed by two&nbsp;20-minute races at&nbsp;14:40 and 17:45.

Mazza had made a bad start and was back down in 5th.</p>\n\n<p>Onto lap 2, and in a strange turn of events, 3 cars ran wide and even spun at turn 7. First was Bukhantsov, then Sweetnam and Monie spinning off into the run off. Interestingly after the race it was thought that strong winds had contributed to this!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/885/original/CKD_5922.jpeg?1671019776 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/885/std/CKD_5922.jpeg?1671019776\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/885/std/CKD_5922.jpeg?1671019776\"></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Recker had caught the back of 2nd place Feyzulin, but Mazza had moved up to 4th, and was hot on the heals of Recker, making for a three way battle.</p>\n\n<p>Putting in fast laps, one after another, Mazza had impressively moved past Recker and Feyzulin and up to second, now to hunt down Bukhantsov!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/884/original/CKD_6003.jpeg?1671019776 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/884/std/CKD_6003.jpeg?1671019776\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/884/std/CKD_6003.jpeg?1671019776\"></p>\n\n<p>In the last minutes of the race Mazza had got the gap down to just 0.589, but he was unable to get close enough to make a pass, so it was Bukhantsov taking the win. Mazza second and Feyzulin third. Recker just 0.4 behind in fourth.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/883/original/CKD_6083.jpeg?1671019776 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/883/std/CKD_6083.jpeg?1671019776\" width=\"375\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/883/std/CKD_6083.jpeg?1671019776\"></p>\n\n<p>Race two started a few hours later, and again it was Bukhantsov taking the lead, but behind was an immense three way battle for second, between Feyzulin, Sweetnam and Recker. As the three of them came into the last corner Recker put an incredible move in, out braking both cars and up to second. This forced Feyzulin wide, Sweetnam slipped through dumping Feyzulin back to fourth!</p>\n\n<p>Mazza had made another uncharacteristically bad start and was again on the charge back to the sharp end of the field. But with the scrapping Feyzulin and Sweetnam, it allowed him to get close and slip up to third on lap 3. Then passing Sweetnam into the last corner a lap later.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/882/original/CKD_5648.jpeg?1671019775 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/882/std/CKD_5648.jpeg?1671019775\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/882/std/CKD_5648.jpeg?1671019775\"></p>\n\n<p>In second and with some clear air, Recker was the fastest car on the track and catching Bukhantsov, with still 17 mins left to run. Pushing hard and with only 5 mins to go he had got the gap down to 0.438, but with back markers approaching Bukhantsov was able to widen the gap, slipping through at a critical moment leaving Recker trailing. Also, Mazza had slipped past the back markers well and was now on the tail of Recker in the dying moments of the race.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/881/original/CKD_7190.jpeg?1671019775 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/881/std/CKD_7190.jpeg?1671019775\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/881/std/CKD_7190.jpeg?1671019775\"></p>\n\n<p>As the pair flew though the notorious turn 6 to 7 complex, Recker ran a little wide, allowing Mazza to make his move. And that was it, a great race and another win for Bukhantsov. It seems if Mazza could finally make a good start he would be unbeatable!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/880/original/CKD_6828.jpeg?1671019774 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/880/std/CKD_6828.jpeg?1671019774\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/880/std/CKD_6828.jpeg?1671019774\"></p>\n\n<p>The Enduro race took place the following day, and again it was Bukantsov taking the victory from Mazza and Feyzulin in third. Recker had been in the mix but was plagued by fuel pump issues that took him out off the race.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/878/original/CKD_7232.jpeg?1671019773 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/878/std/CKD_7232.jpeg?1671019773\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/878/std/CKD_7232.jpeg?1671019773\"></p>\n\n<p>So a clean sweep for Bukhantsov this weekend, but some new faces to the championship and podium. Yas in a few weeks for sure will be a very interesting one.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/879/original/CKD_7530.jpeg?1671019773 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/879/std/CKD_7530.jpeg?1671019773\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/879/std/CKD_7530.jpeg?1671019773\"></p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@RadicalMotorsport\">RECAP ALL THE RACES AT RADICAL MOTORSPORT YOUTUBE</a>"

The team also secured third overall in their Radical SR3. Crossing the line shortly behind&nbsp;the Flying Lizard Motorsports Audi R8 and Competition Motorsports Porsche GT3.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the race, the teams had covered nearly the equivalent of driving from coast-to-coast across the United States in 25 hours. It was a fantastic effort by the team with, George Kurtz, Dave House, Kenton Koch and European Masters competitor Gerhard Watzinger at the wheel.</p>\n\n<p>The event saw more than 50 teams participate in the famed endurance race that tested drivers’ resolve against machine and fatigue. Much of the race is run in darkness, further challenging the field of amateur and professional drivers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;“I had&nbsp;five hours of absolute thrashing” said driver Kenton Koch. A pair of Ginetta G57 cars that were favorites to win the overall race and class had mechanical issues and dropped out late in the race.

          "content": "<p>Scoring his second pole position of his debut racing season on Sunday morning, the 360 Racing driver was the man to beat from early-on in the session with a time of 1:26.230. James Pinkerton was initially de Sadeleer’s closest rival but David Thompson’s constantly improving form saw the Nielsen Racing boss climb the order to earn second on the grid, Pinkerton third. Andrew Ritchie clocked in fourth, ahead of SR3 racer Mark Crader and David Tagg.</p>\n\n<p>Although declared a wet race thanks to a late morning rain shower, the first SR1 Cup race of the weekend got away in dry conditions on Sunday lunchtime. Ritchie secured the best start of the Radical SR1 field, charging through from the second row to run three wide with Thompson and a slow away de Sadeleer heading into turn one. Thompson emerged the early leader into Deene with de Sadeleer in hot pursuit, but a slight run wide from the #10 car gave de Sadeleer all the invitation he needed to slip through into the lead at Gracelands.</p>\n\n<p>While Thompson held strong in second, the battle for third intensified behind as Pinkerton glued himself to the rear of Ritchie’s SR1 for much of the following three laps before claiming third exiting Brook chicane on lap four. On a charge, Pinkerton proceeded to take chunks of time out of Thompson to halve the Nielsen Racing car’s advantage ahead of a single lap safety car to retrieve Mark Crader’s car from Chapman Curve, as the field closed up once more.</p>\n\n<p>Back to green flag racing with four minutes remaining, all eyes were on the Pinkerton / Thompson battle and, although Pinkerton initially looked to threaten, Thompson upped the pace to pull 0.409 seconds clear at the chequered flag. De Sadeleer’s outstanding form secured his second win of the season while Thompson and Pinkerton each enjoyed their first appearances on the Radical SR1 Cup podium.</p>\n\n<p>With all four drivers occupying the first two grid rows clean away for round four on Sunday afternoon, de Sadeleer gained the upper hand amid the four-wide dash to turn one and, once out in front, the talented newcomer continued to build his unabated pace to the chequered flag.</p>\n\n<p>As the fight for the remaining places on the rostrum began to unfold, Ritchie and Pinkerton looked set for a 20-minute re-match of their thrilling race one battle. This time, however, Ritchie had the measure of the Works team car, despite Pinkerton never allowing the Nielsen Racing charge more than 0.4 seconds of breathing space.</p>\n\n<p>The charging duo even threatened to make it a three-car fight for second place as they caught Thompson at the mid-way marker, but the Nielsen Racing boss picked up his pace to pull clear unchallenged.</p>\n\n<p>Nigel Paine put in a noteworthy performance to recover from a delayed getaway to work his way up to sixth spot and challenge David Tagg for the Fangio Trophy class lead in the closing stages. A spin from Tagg at Tarzan on the penultimate tour concluded that battle, ensuring Paine a superb fifth place finish while Tagg swiftly recovered to hang on to second in class, sixth overall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jérôme de Sadeleer</strong> – Double race winner: “I’m really happy. Team 360 Racing did a really great job getting the car ready. We worked through a few issues and I was happy with the car on Friday. To get pole position, two wins and fastest laps, I couldn’t be happier.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>David Thompson</strong> – Second, Rounds 3&amp;4: “It was a slightly easier race for me in the second one, with no one breathing down my neck. I was more consistent in myself and learned a few things from race one, so all-in-all it was an improvement. I got a little bit sloppy halfway through race two and the guys behind caught me up, so I told myself ‘right, okay, focus’ and I was able to go again.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>James Pinkerton</strong> – Third, Race 1 / Round 3: “The car felt really good. I was very concerned about the rain, but it was all good, the car was perfect, so couldn’t ask for anything more. I came here fresh this morning and it’s the first time I’ve driven here, so it’s really good.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Andrew Ritchie</strong> – Third, Race 2 / Round 4: “It’s fantastic for me, this is my home race and it’s my third ever SR1 race so to get a podium is fantastic. I said to the guys at Brands that this was my goal for the season and I’ve done it and I’m over the moon. It was good to have a bit of a battle with David, for a while I thought I might have got him. But it’s good for Neilsen to have a 2-3 result.”</p>\n\n<p>For full Rockingham race results visit <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com/\">www.tsl-timing.com</a></p>"

          "content": "<p>Title protagonist Dominik Jackson took the final win of the weekend amid a dramatic Rockingham farewell which saw arch rival and teammate Steve Burgess forced to record a double DNF. A single point separated the pair ahead of the round six battles, Jackson now holds a 76-point advantage heading into the final event at Silverstone next month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Outgoing Radical SR1 Champion de Sadeleer notched up his second win of his maiden Radical Challenge season, in the first of three races at Rockingham. Bouncing back after a rotten run of luck last time out at Snetterton, the 360 Racing driver took a decisive win from third on the grid to maintain his 100% winning record at the oval.</p>\n\n<p>The fierce championship battle continued with Burgess stretching his lead to 16 points thanks to a third-place podium from pole position. Jackson kept his title hopes alive with vital points for fifth despite a race littered with a maximum success penalty, five second track-limits penalty plus an uncharacteristic spin.</p>\n\n<p>Clean away at the rolling start, the leading duo battled wheel-to-wheel heading down to turn one and then again into the hairpin. Although Burgess emerged the leader, the field soon came under safety car conditions with a spin from Richard Baxter causing the pursuing pack to take evasive action.</p>\n\n<p>Racing proper resumed one lap later, Burgess leading from Jackson and de Sadeleer as the trio traded fastest laps as they pulled clear of the field. Rarely straying more the 0.5 seconds adrift of his RAW Motorsport teammate’s rear wing, Jackson looked promising to make a pass until a spin at Deene dropped him to third ahead of the pit stops.</p>\n\n<p>Once the stops played out, it was a penalty-free de Sadeleer that emerged the leader. Burgess held second until a spin at Deene with 11 minutes to go let Brian Caudwell sneak through. Re-joining in fourth, former champ Burgess pushed to catch Marcello Marateotto, up to a fantastic third from 18th on the grid, taking the final place on the podium with five minutes remaining.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jackson, meanwhile, battled back from a maximum success penalty to bag valuable points for fifth overall, while Mark Richards rounded out the top six with the fastest lap to his credit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Swiss ace de Sadeleer doubled up with a second win on Sunday morning, emerging victorious from a safety-car littered race two which resulted in just a handful of laps under full racing conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst de Sadeleer’s third win promotes him to third in the championship order, an incident ridden race saw title protagonists Burgess and Jackson come together. That forced Burgess’ retirement whilst a resulting penalty dropped Jackson from second to the back of the results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consistency finally paid off for RAW Motorsport’s Elliot Goodman, who was rewarded with his first career Challenge podium and second overall, after Jackson’s infringement and Brian Caudwell’s 10-second penalty for a false start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, Brian Murphy inherited his second podium of the season with third overall. Fifth on the road, Richard Baxter was in turn promoted to fourth, John MacLeod to fifth and John Caudwell to sixth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>With top title contenders, Jackson and Burgess starting 11th and 16th respectively, race three promised to be a thrilling final battle and fitting farewell to Radical’s home track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Pole-man de Sadeleer led the field clean away at the rolling start, fending off the early intentions of Elliot Goodman before securing the lead at Deene. But, once the opening lap played out, Richards sat second ahead of a storming Jackson in third. Burgess meanwhile, was already on a mission and sitting seventh come lap three.</p>\n\n<p>With Burgess edging ever closer, Jackson set his sights on second and pressured 360 Racing’s Richards into a mistake under braking at Deene. That allowed the RAW Motorsport man to push on to catch de Sadeleer 1.4 seconds up the track, the leading duo taking turns to swap fastest laps before Jackson opted to stop early in the pit window.</p>\n\n<p>Pit stops complete and a success penalty free Jackson emerged leader, heading Richards by a decisive margin which would remain unchallenged. Second place Richards instead had to focus on a hard-charging de Sadeleer, fighting back from his maximum pit stop penalty carried over from his race one win at a rate of over a second a lap.</p>\n\n<p>A spin from Murphy at Brooke with around four minutes remaining, however, called that battle short, as with 75% race distance complete a result was declared and red flag shown.</p>\n\n<p>Agonisingly, an outstanding drive up to fourth from Burgess went completely unrewarded with a mechanical retirement just two laps prior.</p>\n\n<p>Stellar drives from both Marateotto and Kristian Jeffrey turned 18th and 20th on the grid into fourth and fifth place finishes respectively. Sunoco Driver of the Weekend, Elliot Goodman wrapped up a superb event with another top six result.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver quotes:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jerome de Sadeleer (Winner races one and two, third race three:</strong> “You never have a lot of time to rest here, I’m kind of sad this place is closing down. I managed my races well and I’ve driven cleanly. I wasn’t on maximum attack compared to Steve and Dom and drove with my head, but I made sure I was right there when it mattered. My 20-second penalty on the race three pit stop was a big disadvantage. The car was superb, and the team did a great job all weekend. I plan on being just as quick at Silverstone and maintain third place in the championship.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominik Jackson (Winner race three):</strong> “It was nice to have a clean race. I quite enjoyed starting tenth and having a bit of a dice in the first few laps, that was quite good fun. There are so many points to gain for a win, there was only one point in it coming into this weekend. There's a gap now but it's still doable for either of us.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brian Caudwell (Second race one): </strong>“It was fabulous. I've had a tough couple of seasons, but Rockingham has been good to me over the years. Part of me thought it was my day just because we're here!”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Steve Burgess (Third race one): </strong>“It was a good start, I managed to get ahead of Dominik, but I struggled for pace. We changed the car to help save the tyres but struggled with grip. After the stops I pushed a bit too hard and spun.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elliot Goodman (Second race two):</strong> “It's a good result. It was a case of driving round and making sure I got a good restart from behind the safety car each time, which I was able to do. It's good to get a podium though, it still counts!”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brian Murphy (Third race two): </strong>“I've never felt like this before as I crossed the line sixth! But it's interesting to come third after that, but I'll take it! If can finish in the top six again in the final race, I'll be happy.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mark Richards (Second race three):</strong> “I'm very happy but there might have been a chance of first. The three of us (Jackson and de Sadeleer) were lapping so close to each other. I had the pace, but Dom's pressure caused me to out-brake myself, but I can't complain with second.”</p>\n\n<p>The Radical Challenge 2018 championship battle now goes down to the season finale around at the Silverstone Grand Prix circuit, 13-14 October.</p>"

Over 20 drivers from eight different countries experienced the Radical SR1 on the famous Formula One circuit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Romania awarded Dealer of the Year for Europe and Middle East</strong></p>\n\n<p>After fewer than three months since its launch in October 2020, the burgeoning Radical Romania was awarded Dealer of the Year for the European and Middle East regions.</p>\n\n<p>Represented by Bucharest-based SMART DRIVING, Radical Romania marks the first official presence of the brand in the Balkans region, with a fleet of four entry-level SR1s available to lease for track days and racing. Radical Romania has successfully continued 2020’s momentum into the new year with the RLR Radical Sprint Cup eSports championship, currently underway on the iRacing platform, which will soon be joined on track by the debut season of the Radical Romanian Cup.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking at Radical Sportscars’ Cambridgeshire factory, Radical Sportscars Global Sales Director, Dan Redpath, said:</p>\n\n<p>“The Radical Sportscars Dealer of the Year accolade represents the zenith of standards in our dealer network, and the winning partners should be extremely proud of their achievements.</p>\n\n<p>“Although the industry experienced challenging trading conditions in 2020, the launches of the SR3 XX and SR10 proved highly popular with both Radical Sportscars’ loyal customer base and new-to-brand customers alike.</p>\n\n<p>“I would like to extend my personal thanks and appreciation to Jason Plotke and the team from Radical Arizona, Jaewoo Kim and the team from Radical Korea, and Andrea Fogliazzi and the team from Radical Romania.</p>\n\n<p>“Our global dealer network as well as our product line-up is the strongest it has ever been, and 2021 is set to be an exciting year for the brand.”</p>\n\n<p>Radical Sportscars congratulates all its dealers around the world for achieving strong results in a globally challenging market, as it looks forward to continuing this momentum into 2021.</p>"

Degnbol had pitted from a comfortable lead, but on his out lap he attempted to lap Jacek Zielonka around the outside at Druids and crashed heavily.</p>\n\n<p>With four laps behind the safety car Bolger was able to make his stop under caution and still rejoin with his lead intact.</p>\n\n<p>RAW’s Chris Preen had also stayed out and pitted from second, which left Ayres as the new second man, from Macleod, Goodman, Tyler and Preen.</p>\n\n<p>But there had been dramas in the pitlane after Macleod and 360’s James Sweetnam collided, as the RAW driver went to rejoin. Sweetnam had been eighth, but with damaged suspension he went no further.</p>\n\n<p>Bolger held onto his comfortable lead however to take a maiden Radical Challenge victory, with Ayres a comfortable second. “The safety car had saved us, so I had to get tactical. I got back into second after the stops but couldn’t catch Dougie,” Ayres explained.</p>\n\n<p>Macleod had been third, holding off Goodman, was given a late drive through penalty for unsafe release. “I couldn’t shake-off Elliott as my car was damaged and I pitted to take the flag in the pitlane, but that didn’t count and I wasn’t classified,” he explained.</p>\n\n<p>As Macleod headed pitwards Goodman moved up to take third. “It helped as most of the cars in front at the stops had success penalties and it was nice when we had the safety car too, it gave us a breather as it was so hot,” Goodman added.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/802/original/D8F_3374.jpg?1660663603 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/802/std/D8F_3374.jpg?1660663603\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/802/std/D8F_3374.jpg?1660663603\"></p>\n\n<p>Tyler therefore moved up to fourth on the last lap and was almost caught by Lay at the flag. “I just missed the pitlane incident and spent the rest of the race chasing Elliott,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Lay had made it into fifth after taking Preen on the last lap, he had also got past Stone two laps earlier. Preen rounded off the top six, from Stone, with Williams in eighth, as the SR1 Class leaders completed the top 10.</p>\n\n<h2>SR1 CUP - DE LEON TAKES ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS SR1 TITLE</h2>\n\n<p>Tom Wood managed to turn his pole position into a lights to flag win in race one.</p>\n\n<p>“Everything went to plan, we had good pace and to win is always encouraging for the students,” said the Derby University driver after taking the flag over eight seconds clear.</p>\n\n<p>Daryl De Leon had his hands full keeping Track Focused’s Frazer McFadden at bay for second. “Tom was just faster than me and when my rear anti rollbar snapped there was no way I would catch him,” said the Valour Racing driver.</p>\n\n<p>McFadden retained a solid third , with DW’s Ben Caisley fourth. “I could see the others sliding about so I decided to conserve my tyres and just be consistent,” said Caisley.</p>\n\n<p>George Knutton was a racelong fifth for Track Focused, with Scorpio’s Brian Caudwell completing the top six, after ousting James Ockenden’s works car mid-race.</p>\n\n<p>Debutant Paul Denning, returnee David “Sven” Thompson and James Hadley rounded off the top 10.</p>\n\n<p>There was a terrific battle from the start of race two. Initially it was McFadden leading Wood and De Leon, but Wood was soon heading pitwards to retire.</p>\n\n<p>Through Old Hall a front damper broke, I had tried to keep going but nearly had a big off, so had to pit,” Wood explained.</p>\n\n<p>De Leon was left chasing McFadden for the next eight laps. “I got alongside at Druids and decided to back out, then kept showing the nose. I went for it at Lodge but went in too deep, but the next lap I tried and got him,” De Leon explained.</p>\n\n<p>McFadden had to settle for second, with Caisley third. “I watched a good race, tried to get involved the stayed at a safe distance,” said Caisley</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/805/original/D8F_3160.jpg?1660663605 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/805/std/D8F_3160.jpg?1660663605\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/805/std/D8F_3160.jpg?1660663605\"></p>\n\n<p>Ockenden was a solitary fourth, with Hadley, Denning and Darren Knutton the rest of the finishers, after Caudwell and Thompson retired.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the SR1’s also came out in the Enduro, with Caisley taking the class win from team mate Thompson, who had ELMS racer Ben Hanley sharing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The final rounds of both Championships takes place at Donington Park on September 17th/18th.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Published by Peter Scherer for Radical Sportscars, August 16th</em></p>"

After slowing for two laps behind the safety car, it was another four laps at full speed before the field was slowed once again, this time for three laps. With time winding down, it was a two-lap shootout to the end for the win.</p>\n\n<p>In the Platinum class, the expected shootout between Radical UK Champion DeLeon (Valour Racing) and Indy Al Miller (ONE Motorsport) failed to materialize early on as an off-course excursion by Miller relegated him down the running order. Rebounding in the end, it was DeLeon who was able to drive to the Platinum class victory, a win that cemented his dream season. Miller clawed his way back through the field to finish second, 4.257s adrift of DeLeon with former American Le Mans Series champ Jon Field (ONE Motorsport) completing the podium in third.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/874/original/6.jpg?1668700102 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/874/std/6.jpg?1668700102\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/874/std/6.jpg?1668700102\"></p>\n\n<p>It was an amazing drive for Miller to get back ahead of Field late in the race after two trips off the tarmac put him behind what could have been an eventual race win. With the top-three drivers finishing within 5.7s of one another, the pressure was high in difficult conditions. Scott Wagner (ESSES Racing) completed his World Finals weekend in fourth, missing the podium by one position as he finished ahead of the fifth-place runner of Judd Miller (ESSES Racing).</p>\n\n<p>Indy Lights star and 2019 Portland Grand Prix race winner Toby Sowery (Valour Racing) was the dominant driver in the Pro 1500 ranks and carried that domination through Championship Sunday. Scoring the fastest race lap by nearly 0.5s, Sowery topped the podium blocks in a weekend that featured a pole position, two of three heat race wins, and the main event victory. Danny Dyszelski (WISKO Racing) rebounded from a power issue in one of the heat races to find his place on the second step of the podium, while Championship Sunday’s main event polesitter Gorski (ONE Motorsport) crossed the stripe in third. Gorski, consistent all weekend, was unable to hold the younger drivers at bay but was happy with his front-of-the-field presence all weekend long.</p>\n\n<p>Former 2021 Pro 1500 North American Champion Gustavo Rafols looked poised for a podium position as he battled with Dyszelski for second before an off-track experience ruined his chances of a top-three result. Nick Groat (Spring Mountain) improved throughout the weekend and took advantage of some other driver’s misfortunes in the main event to secure a top-five result in the fourth position while Tanner Harvey (Spring Mountain) ended his Radical World Finals Presented by Hankook in fifth.</p>\n\n<p>It was Stephens (Team Stradale) who led the Pro 1340 field to the green flag from the inside of the front row courtesy of his heat two and three wins but in the end, it was hometown hero Patrick Liddy (Spring Mountain) who found his name at the top of the results sheets. Finishing eighth overall but first in class, Liddy was able to overtake Stephens late in the race to earn the World Finals victory. Stephens held on to the second position on route to the fastest lap of the race in the Pro 1340 ranks as he finished just 0.5s ahead of Jonathan Woolridge (Radical Canada East) in third.</p>\n\n<p>Woolridge was on a steady rise all weekend long and continually improved with each passing on-track session, saving his best result of the event for the finals. Chris McMurry (CROWN Concepts) crossed the line in fourth earning a top-five result for Crown Concepts while Jason Plotke (CROWN Concepts) put a pair of Crown Racing drivers in the top-five finishing fifth.</p>\n\n<p>With the first Radical World Finals Presented by Hankook now in the record books, Radical Motorsport officials are already in the planning stages of the 2023 edition of the event.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/871/original/3.jpg?1668700096 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/871/std/3.jpg?1668700096\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/871/std/3.jpg?1668700096\"></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/870/original/1.jpg?1668700094 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/870/std/1.jpg?1668700094\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/870/std/1.jpg?1668700094\"></p>"

The move into the former Formula E headquarters comes after Radical Motorsport’s most successful year in its 25-year history, and marks a historic moment for the company, moving the customer-facing sales and marketing teams away from its factory in Peterborough for the first time since its incorporation.</p>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport’s manufacturing and production base will remain at the Peterborough factory, with customer-facing and commercial departments expanding to the new Donington Park facility. The factory in Peterborough has been home to Radical Motorsport since it was founded 26 years ago in 1997, and the company remains fully committed to its roots in Cambridgeshire.</p>\n\n<p>The new Radical Motorsport corporate HQ is set to become a destination for owners and fans alike, a venue for automotive events and a unique meeting space for business partners and corporate reservations. Open to the public throughout the year Monday to Friday (9 am to 5 pm) and on selected race weekends, Radical Motorsport will open its doors to welcome all visitors to Donington Park.</p>\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, in addition to the office space for its sales, marketing, and motorsport staff, the premises will be able to provide the expanding Radical Motorsport dealer network with dedicated training opportunities to be able to better serve its growing customer base across the world.</p>\n\n<p>Joe Anwyll, Radical Motorsport CEO, said: “We looked at a number of non-circuit-based locations in the UK to host our expanding commercial team. However, with British motorsport tracks widely known as being some of the best in the world, we had to take this opportunity, as a British motorsport manufacturer, to be right on the doorstep of the action.</p>\n\n<p>“As well as our expanding team and record production numbers this year, this move to Donington Park will allow us to pursue ventures we’ve been unable to from our factory. Our cars belong on track, so it’s only fitting we be present there too.”</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan Palmer, Chief Executive of circuit operator MotorSport Vision (MSV), commented: “I’m delighted that Radical Motorsport has decided to move its corporate headquarters to Donington Park. Since MSV took over the running of the venue in 2018, it’s been our ambition not just to create an improved competitor and spectator experience, which we’ve already achieved through numerous venue improvements, but also to elevate the circuit’s standing as a major national hub of motorsport businesses.</p>\n\n<p>“Radical Motorsport is a much-admired and globally recognised manufacturer of sports racing cars, and I’m delighted it’s recognised the significant benefits of being based at one of the UK’s leading race circuits. With the addition of Radical Motorsport alongside a growing portfolio of businesses, and further developments planned at the estate, including the renovation of Donington Hall as an incredible mansion house hotel, the future for the site is looking very bright indeed.</p>\n\n<p>“I extend a very warm welcome to Joe Anwyll and his team and look forward to seeing the completed facility soon.”</p>\n\n<p>Plans are afoot for the new facility to complete and open to the public Spring 2023, and more information will be published at radicalmotorsport.com or on Radical Motorsport’s social media channels.</p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-</p>\n\n<h3>NOTES TO EDITORS</h3>\n\n<p><em>Radical Motorsport enjoyed unprecedented growth in its 25th year, building and selling more cars in 2022 than at any other time in its history. A 33-strong global dealer network spanning 21 countries underpins this growth, and there are now 12 single-make Radical Cup championships across four different continents, including the factory-supported Hagerty Radical Cup UK and the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Radical Motorsport is one of the world’s most prolific sports car manufacturers, with over 2,800 cars produced in the past 25 years. From its 1997 inception, Radical set out to create a customer-lead niche in the world of motorsport, a race-bred thrill-a-minute driving experience on the racetrack and road.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A combination of lightweight construction, superbike-derived technology and aerodynamic downforce delivers models faster than a supercar, totally driver-focused and rewarding to drive. Entering its third decade, the Radical stable includes the entry-level SR1, the best-selling SR3, turbo-charged SR10, and iconic RXC available in GT3 and Spyder variants. The turbocharged SR10 was launched in early 2021 and headlines Radical’s SR product range with over 425 bhp and 380 lb-ft of torque for blistering performance. All models from the renowned racing car manufacturer are solely designed, engineered and built at Radical’s Cambridgeshire headquarters, by 70 of the company’s 130-strong staff.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Radical was the first manufacturer to bring long-format, double-header endurance racing to competitive motorsport while providing comprehensive spares and technical support. The marque’s official single-make championships offer the ultimate driving experience and progressive racing ladder for prototype-style sports car racing for drivers of all abilities, while Radical’s ‘Race the World’ mission offers an end-to-end racing, training and support network across the globe.</em></p>\n\n<h3>Contact:</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jon Roach</strong></p>\n\n<p>Global Head of Marketing, Radical Motorsport, <a href=\"mailto:jon.roach@radicalmotorsport.com\">jon.roach@radicalmotorsport.com</a>,</p>\n\n<p>+44 (0)7887 836499</p>\n\n<p><strong>Holly Webb</strong></p>\n\n<p>Digital Marketing Co-ordinator, Radical Motorsport, <a href=\"mailto:holly.webb@radicalmotorsport.com\">holly.webb@radicalmotorsport.com</a>,</p>\n\n<p>+44 (0)1733 331 616</p>"

First introduced by Omologato in 2017, the Tifosi collection is a timepiece designed to be affordable, durable and wearable at racetracks around the world.

Founder Shami Kalra is a lifelong motorsport enthusiast who has developed hand-made timepieces inspired by four and two-wheel models. Taken from the Italian language, Omologato simply means Homologated or ‘Ready to Race’. The company’s ethos is ingrained with chronographs incorporating design cues that reflect the true spirit of motor racing.</p>\n\n<p>Commenting on the partnership, Jon Roach, Global Head of Marketing at Radical Motorsport, said: “This partnership is the perfect project to showcase our two products. Omologato is a fellow British brand with a clear passion for motorsport and is well respected by racing drivers around the world. We’re looking forward to working with them [Omologato] and seeing the ‘Radical Edition’ watches in paddocks around the world soon.”</p>\n\n<p>Shami Kalra, Founder and CEO of Omologato, added: “As a brand that was built to celebrate motorsport, the community of fans and racers, and manufacture stand-out commemorative racing-inspired timepieces, we’re overjoyed to become Radical Motorsport’s Watch Partner. The relationship is one I hope will grow over time – pardon the pun – with the start being a ‘Radical Edition’ of our popular Omologato Tifosi and various sponsorship activations, and hopefully grow from there. It’s going to be a great year for both of our British-headquartered brands, in 2023.”</p>\n\n<p>Priced at £150, the Tifosi Radical Edition is available to pre-order at <a href=\"https://www.omologatowatches.com/radical\">omologatowatches.com/radical</a> and purchase at selected Radical events. Drivers who register to race in the 2023 season of the Hagerty Radical Cup UK will receive a complementary Omologato ‘Radical Edition’ watch if their entries are received in January 2023.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-ENDS-</strong></p>\n\n<h2>NOTES TO EDITORS</h2>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport enjoyed unprecedented growth in its 25th year, building and selling more cars in 2022 than at any other time in its history.

As a European manufacturer, it is important to support our loyal Radical owners here, and I am confident that our two newly-appointed partners will be instrumental to the growth of our brand in the years to come.”</p>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport is quickly becoming the race car of choice for motorsport and car club members wanting faster, more competitive cars.

The turbocharged SR10 was launched in early 2021 and headlines Radical’s SR product range with over 425bhp and 380lb-ft of torque for blistering performance. All models from the renowned racing car manufacturer are solely designed, engineered and built at Radical’s Cambridgeshire headquarters, by 70 of the company’s 130-strong staff.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Radical was the first manufacturer to bring long-format, double-header endurance racing to competitive motorsport while providing comprehensive spares and technical support.

          "content": "<p>The 21-year-old double Jamaica Race Drivers Club MP2 Champion signalled his intentions in the first of two Free Practice sessions, leading the field with a time of 59.388s, one quarter of a second up on Mark Maloney; promising a good day’s competition, Trinidad &amp; Tobago’s Kristian Boodoosingh and Sean Maloney of Barbados completed a quartet of drivers covered by less than half a second.</p>\n\n<p>While Sean topped the second FP session times, Mark was fastest in Qualifying, adding a ninth Pole Position to his record, with Myers, Sean and T&amp;T’s Luke Bhola all within three-tenths of pole. Bhola’s time was later disallowed, as his SR3 was found to be underweight, so he dropped to the back of the grid behind Stuart Maloney, Boodoosingh and the second series newcomer, Jamaica’s Horatio Brown, making his car racing debut.</p>\n\n<p>Starting from the southern grid, pole man Maloney powered downhill into the ‘W’s to take a lead he was not to lose in the first 15-lapper; while he was never challenged, his brother Sean came under constant pressure from Myers, having passed him on the opening lap, the Jamaican seeking any opportunity to pass. The fastest lap changed hands from Myers, as he closed in on Sean, to Maloney as he fought back, then finally to Mark Maloney, increasing his record of fastest laps to 22. After passing Brown just after mid-distance, Bhola chased down a six-second gap to Stuart Maloney, to finish just feet behind him, while Boodoosingh retired when his ECU lost power.</p>\n\n<p>Brown and Bhola sat on the front row of the reversed grid for the second race, Stuart and Sean Maloney on row two, with Mark Maloney and Myers at the back, Boodoosingh out for the rest of the day. When the lights went out, Bhola did not move, the rest flooding around him left and right, Stuart and Mark Maloney surging ahead, initially with Sean in third place. Myers found a way past Sean on lap two, these four becoming a high-speed, nose-to-tail train for the remaining laps; the spread across the four cars was never more than 2secs but, despite a number of attacking moves, the order remained the same. Stuart Maloney’s victory was his 18th in the SR3 Cup, while Sean’s fastest lap was his 10th. Once Bhola got started, he hunted down the yellow SR3 of Brown, but spun in his attempt to pass, handing Brown his best result so far.</p>\n\n<p>Based on points scored in the first two races, Mark and Stuart Maloney were on the front row for the day’s final encounter, with Myers and Sean on row two, Bhola and Brown at the back. Another perfect start from the pole-sitter saw him edge away from the trio behind him, Stuart, Sean and Myers battling for second place; when Stuart spun on the exit of the W’s, Sean and Myers were through in a flash, Bhola and Brown also benefitting while Maloney recovered. Mark Maloney’s margin of victory was the biggest of the day, at a little over 3secs, but it was Myers who came through in second place, clocking the day’s final fastest lap, having passed Sean Maloney on the last tour, while Bhola finished fourth, equalling his best SR3 Cup result to date.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/radical-caribbean-cup\">CARIBBEAN CUP</a>\n\n    <p><a class=\"button button--revealer\" data-panel-reveal=\"reveal-panel-751\" data-reveal-label=\"Read More\" data-hide-label=\"Hide It\">Read More</a></p>\n    <div id=\"reveal-panel-751\" data-reveal-copy=\"\">\n      <p><strong>Radical Caribbean SR3 Cup, round 1<br>\nBushy Park Barbados (April 29)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Qualifying:<strong> </strong>Pole - Mark Maloney (BAR) - Rock Hard Cement/Bushy Park Barbados Radical SR3 RS, 50.097s, 122.443kmh/76.08mph 2nd - William Myers (JAM) - KFC Radical SR3 RS, + 0.189s 3rd - Sean Maloney (BAR) - Bushy Park Barbados Radical SR3 RS, + 0.283s 4th - Stuart Maloney (BAR) - Bushy Park Barbados Radical SR3 RS, + 0.472s 5th - Kristian Boodoosingh (T&amp;T) - CR Boodoosingh &amp; Sons Ltd/Fast Parts/Torco Race Fuels/Richtune/Garage 61/TechPoint Tuning Radical SR3 RS, + 0.712s 6th - Horatio Brown (JAM) - Fast Parts/Torco Race Fuels/Car Boutique/Redline Oils/ Richtune/Bhola's Marketing Radical SR3 RS, + 1.389s Luke Bhola (T&amp;T) - Bholas Marketing/Fast Parts/Torco Race Fuels/Richtune/Garage 61/TechPoint Tuning Radical SR3 RS * time disallowed, underweight</p>\n\n<p>Race 1 (15 laps): 1st M Maloney, 17m 06.403s; 2nd Sean Maloney, + 1.560s; 3rd Myers, + 2.087s; 4th Stuart Maloney, + 14.257s; 5th Bhola, + 14.612s; 6th Brown, + 33.130s.

          "content": "<p>Primal Motorsports, based at Atlanta Motorsports Park and Team Stradale, based at Autobahn Country Club in Illinois,&nbsp;tied for 2022 Dealer of the Year award for North America, while Radical UAE emerged victorious for the ‘Rest of World’ category. Dealers Radical Canada East, Radical USA Nevada and Radical USA Arizona also enjoyed accolades.</p>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport’s Dealer of the Year awards aim to recognise the highest performing members of their international dealer network, that now includes over 30 dealers in more than 20 countries. All Radical Motorsport dealers aim to make the Radical ethos ‘we make racers’ a reality, offering sales and trackside support for the full Radical range, as well as ‘arrive and drive’ programs across track days, tests and race events.</p>\n\n<h3>Dealer of the Year, North America</h3>\n\n<p>Based out of the Atlanta Motorsports Park, Primal Motorsports accelerated through the ranks through the success of their Primal Racing School. With programs showcasing the power and performance of the Radical SR1, the Primal Racing School is a Sports Car Club of America accredited racing school offering beginner and advanced programs.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Nicol, Primal Racing CEO, said: \"The entire Primal Racing Group family is proud to have won the 2022 Radical Motorsport Dealer of the Year.&nbsp; 2022 was a whirlwind year for us as we focused intensely on rebuilding our customer base and improving brand recognition after a couple of down years in the market.&nbsp; Thanks to the support and trust from existing, as well as several new customers, we had an outstanding year.&nbsp; Our goal is to provide our customers a solution for whatever their path in motorsports may be.&nbsp; Whether it's a brand-new driver moving through our racing schools, someone needing car prep and track side support, or the experienced racer looking to improve their driving skills or upgrade to a faster vehicle, we have something for everyone.\"</p>\n\n<p>Also sharing first place with Primal Motorsports for the North America Dealer of the Year award, is Team Stradale based in Illinois. Team Stradale were appointed as the Midwestern distributor for Radical in 2013, and quickly became the fastest-growing dealer in the US. Spearheaded by Francesco D’Avola out of their impressive facility at Autobahn Country Club circuit near Chicago, Team Stradale have been instrumental in cementing Radical as the country club track car of choice. This continued into 2022, with Team Stradale also being appointed as Radical’s official dealer in Florida and ultimately winning the overall Dealer of the Year award for the fourth consecutive time.</p>\n\n<p>Team Stradale’s impressive performance is set to continue, with ongoing success in the Blue Marble Radical Cup.</p>\n\n<p>Francesco D’Avola, Team Stradale owner, said: “Being Radical Motorsport’s highest volume Dealer of the Year for a fourth time is a testament to our unwavering commitment to excellence. Without the support of our amazing customers and the hard work and dedication of our talented team, this achievement would not have been possible. We are grateful to have such a fantastic group of individuals who share our vision and values, and who have contributed to our success. We are proud to serve our customers with the best products and services, and we will continue to work tirelessly to exceed their expectations. Thank you to our customers and team for their unwavering support and commitment to excellence.”</p>\n\n<h3>Dealer of the Year, Rest of World</h3>\n\n<p>As one of the longest-standing members of the Radical Motorsport dealer network, Radical UAE, Gulfsport, has won Dealer of the Year award for the Rest of World region, which spans Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.</p>\n\n<p>Based at the state-of-the-art facility at Dubai Autodrome, Gulfsport has long been a focal point in the Gulf’s motorsport community. Opening in 2004, Gulfsport have been developing the Radical market across the Gulf region for almost twenty years. In 2005, they established the Gulf Radical Cup, that remains one of the most popular of the official Radical championships around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Headed by father-son duo Barry and Martin Hope, 2022 saw great strides from Radical UAE, resulting in them winning not only the overall Dealer of the Year award, but all four awards in the Rest of World categories – Performance award, Constructors award and Push to Pass award.</p>\n\n<p>Martin Hope, Managing Partner of Gulfsport Racing, said: “We are really proud to become 2022 Radical Dealer of the Year. It’s testament to some key aspects of what we&nbsp;have&nbsp;here. Firstly, our dedicated team at GulfSport Racing, secondly, our committed customers here in the Gulf Radical Cup, and lastly the Radical SR3, which continues to be the most enjoyable and rewarding Sportscar out there! We are excited to receive our new SR3 XXR in a few weeks and see where that takes us for the 2023 season”.</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Canada East, Radical USA Nevada and Radical USA Arizona also enjoy accolades in 2022 awards</h3>\n\n<p>Radical’s Dealer of the Year awards are designed to recognise the entire performance of standout dealer both on and off the track, with a collection of secondary awards marking notable performances in other areas.</p>\n\n<p>Radical Canada East, based just outside Toronto, won the Performance award for North America, while Spring Mountain Motor Resort and Country Club, based outside of Las Vegas won the Constructors award as Radical USA Nevada. Radical USA Arizona, APEX Motor Club, won the Push to Pass award – a brand new award introduced for 2022.</p>\n\n<p>In a standout performance, Radical UAE, Gulfsport, claimed all four category awards for the Rest of World region.</p>\n\n<p>Dan Redpath, Group Sales and Marketing Director, said: “our global dealer network is the jewel in Radical’s crown, so I feel very privileged to be able to recognise and reward their contributions to what has been a great year for the company. I would like to personally thank everyone who has worked so hard this year, and I am very excited to show the world what we have planned for 2023”.</p>\n\n<p>Celebrating their 25th anniversary, 2022 was more than just a candle on the cake for Radical Motorsport. Expanding their dealer network with appointment of Team Stradale as Radical Florida and a company rebrand at the start of the year was only beginning. The race season saw 12 official Radical Cup championships take place around the world, with the Radical Cup UK enjoying some of the largest grids its seen and the Radical Cup North America entertaining sell-out crowds alongside NTT IndyCar series once again. With the 100th SR10 model leaving the factory and the announcement of another update to the popular SR3, the year concluded with the inaugural Radical World Finals in Las Vegas.</p>\n\n<p>These accolades have continued into 2023, with three new dealers appointed this year already: Radical Spain, Radical Germany North and Radical Germany South.</p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-</p>\n\n<h3>NOTES TO EDITORS</h3>\n\n<p><em>Radical Motorsport enjoyed unprecedented growth in its 25th year, building and selling more cars in 2022 than at any other time in its history.

          "content": "<p><strong>1 February 2023 Cambridgeshire, UK</strong> – Radical Motorsport, the UK’s largest race car manufacturer, has confirmed it has upgraded its popular SR10 to SR10 XXR format. The introduction of the SR10 XXR comes just one month after the latest model, the SR3 XXR, was released, aligning its two most popular race cars under the XXR banner.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/008/original/Radical_SR10_RHS_Studio_GulfBlue_w_halo.jpg?1675170243 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/008/std/Radical_SR10_RHS_Studio_GulfBlue_w_halo.jpg?1675170243\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/008/std/Radical_SR10_RHS_Studio_GulfBlue_w_halo.jpg?1675170243\"></p>\n\n<p>Proving to be the motorsport country club and track day car of choice, Radical Motorsport has placed over 100 SR10s with customers since the model’s introduction in 2020, with United States-based customers making up 70 per cent of all orders. Bolstering the recognition in racing and popularity, Radical Motorsport has upgraded the SR10 to new SR10 XXR guise.</p>\n\n<p>Months after the SR3 XXR’s introduction, the SR10 XXR has the XXR line’s inspiration of design and engineering upgrades, mated to the SR10’s acclaimed, long-life 425 bhp turbocharged 2.3-litre unit by Radical Performance Engines. Most noticeable for the SR10&nbsp;XXR is its new front louvres, created for better aerodynamics at high speed, reduced understeer and improved cooling efficiency. Creating enhanced stability through corners and at speed, the SR10 XXR is also fitted with the popular LMP-inspired ‘central fin’ feature from the SR3 XXR, alongside new lightweight alloy wheels and high-intensity front DRL light clusters; all as standard. For drivers looking for even more weight reduction, a brand-new carbon splitter and diffuser package is available as a cost option.</p>\n\n<p>Joe Anwyll, Radical Motorsport CEO, said: “The SR10 range has continued to push the boundaries of modern engineering capabilities with the same pure Radical driving experience. Our fastest-selling model in our history, and a favourite with US customers in particular, we’ve been working hard to cherry-pick the best XXR model line upgrades and adding them to our best-selling model, the SR10.</p>\n\n<p>“The last two years have been great to witness, seeing the SR10 be so well received in the track day and country club markets. As well as some impressive styling updates to the bodywork, the addition of the ‘central fin’ and front louvres have proven to increase the SR10 XXR’s usability, allowing drivers to extract even more of the car’s mind-blowing potential. Not only is this a very exciting announcement for all potential new Radical Motorsport owners, but also to our loyal client base, as we thought it was only right that we make these fantastic updates available to them, too.”</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/009/original/Radical_SR10_R3Q_RHS_Studio_GulfBlue_w_halo.jpg?1675170242 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/009/std/Radical_SR10_R3Q_RHS_Studio_GulfBlue_w_halo.jpg?1675170242\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/009/std/Radical_SR10_R3Q_RHS_Studio_GulfBlue_w_halo.jpg?1675170242\"></p>\n\n<p>Delivering on customer feedback, many of the new SR10 XXR updates will be made available to current SR10 owners in the form of a new ‘XXR Evolution Pack’. This will include the XXR’s improved aerodynamic upgrades on the front clam, as well as the new wheel design, optimised cooling and revised set-up, and the carbon fibre bodywork items as an option.</p>\n\n<p>Both SR10 XXR and SR10 models with the ‘XXR Evolution Pack’ will continue to be eligible in international Radical Cup championships within the ‘Platinum’ classes.</p>\n\n<p>Dan Redpath, Group Sales and Marketing Director at Radical Motorsport, said: “We already know why the SR10 has been our fastest-selling model to date. It’s reliable, powerful, and delivers performance like no other car we’ve produced before, while remaining an approachable machine for track day enthusiasts. We’re proud of the lower running costs that come with the SR10 XXR’s long-life 425 bhp engine, and the elements that produce real-time data, creating the ultimate driver’s car. Because of this, we made sure to not forget any of the organic SR10 DNA that is already so popular when we set about optimising it further.”</p>\n\n<p>The updated SR10 XXR is available to order now through Radical Motorsport’s global dealer network, operational through over 30 dealers in more than 20 countries. Production will begin Spring 2023.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/006/original/Radical_SR10_F3Q_RHS_Studio_GulfBlue_w_halo.jpg?1675170240 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/006/std/Radical_SR10_F3Q_RHS_Studio_GulfBlue_w_halo.jpg?1675170240\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/006/std/Radical_SR10_F3Q_RHS_Studio_GulfBlue_w_halo.jpg?1675170240\"></p>\n\n<p>-ENDS-</p>\n\n<h3>NOTES TO EDITORS</h3>\n\n<p><em>Radical Motorsport enjoyed unprecedented growth in its 25th year, building and selling more cars in 2022 than at any other time in its history.

          "content": "<p><em><strong>26 April 2023 Donington, UK</strong> – Radical Motorsport, the UK’s largest race car manufacturer, has today confirmed the most extensive set of updates to its entry-level car, the SR1, in six years. Following XXR treatment to its SR3 and SR10 models, Radical Motorsport has announced the SR1 will be aligned with both under the XXR banner.</em></p>\n\n<p>Since the model’s inception in 2012, the SR1 has been favoured by hundreds of drivers, as an entry-level, first step into racing a Radical. Ideal for enthusiasts looking to take their circuit driving to the next level with a track-focused, downforce-derived racing car, yet with two seats and semi-slick tyres (over full slicks of the SR3 and SR10). In the 11 years since the SR1’s introduction, Radical Motorsport has expanded its global race offering to 12 international race series’ in which the model is eligible to compete, highlighting not only the SR1’s importance but also its popularity.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/054/original/Radical_SR1_XXR_%282%29small.jpg?1682498675 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/054/std/Radical_SR1_XXR_%282%29small.jpg?1682498675\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/054/std/Radical_SR1_XXR_%282%29small.jpg?1682498675\"></p>\n\n<p>The SR1 XXR reveal follows the popular SR3 XXR announcement just four months ago. With similar design and engineering improvements, focusing on ease of use and durability, it also includes advancements to its aerodynamic design in the form of a central LMP-inspired ‘fin’ as standard. The SR1 XXR will be fitted with a new engine, the Generation 5 1,340 cc power unit from Radical’s bespoke engine facility.</p>\n\n<p>Focusing on efficiency, reliability and longevity, Radical Performance Engines (RPE) has increased recommended engine refresh intervals by 25 per cent through its new Generation 5 liquid-cooled, four-cylinder and 16-valve 1,340 cc unit. Resulting in more time on track for SR1 XXR drivers, with a reduced warm-up time and thermal management upgrades, it provides drivers the ability to lap faster and harder, for longer. Alongside this, oil change intervals have also increased from six to ten hours, alongside a new drive-by-wire induction system.</p>\n\n<p>Other notable improvements include durability updates, external gear position sensors for the gearbox and a new scavenge pump design with improved flow for the oiling system. At the same time, a complete rework of the engine and gearbox calibration, as well as improvements to the flow rate of the cylinder head have been made. Further upgrades include a reduction in mass for the connecting rods, crankshaft pins and the ignition system. These enhancements improve engine response and drivability but without compromising on durability. Combined with revised dry sump and cooling systems, improved coil-on-plug ignition systems and new electronic drive-by-wire, the Gen. 5 RPE racing spec engine has been optimised with usability and efficiency at the forefront.</p>\n\n<p>James Pinkerton, Radical Motorsport’s Head of Research and Development and double Radical SR1 Cup Champion, said: “The SR1 will always be special to me, as I’ve witnessed first-hand how approachable it is for drivers wanting to take the step up in their racing careers. When developing the Gen. 5 RPE engine, we wanted to optimise its potential as much as possible, whilst staying true to what makes the SR1 so user-friendly.</p>\n\n<p>“Although the entry-level racer, the SR1 XXR offers an outstanding package with unparalleled performance for the money, that will get you on the grid in a professionally administered race series. SR1 and SR3 models currently make up the majority of grids in the 12 Radical Cup championships around the world, with over 200 SR1s sold to date. Racers with the SR1 XXR will still be eligible to race in the PRO SR1 classes of Radical Cup championships around the world, too.”</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/055/original/Radical_SR1_XXR_%283%29small.jpg?1682498675 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/055/std/Radical_SR1_XXR_%283%29small.jpg?1682498675\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/055/std/Radical_SR1_XXR_%283%29small.jpg?1682498675\"></p>\n\n<p>Joe Anwyll, Radical Motorsport CEO, said: “The SR1 model has been key to Radical’s DNA for over ten years now, by providing aspiring drivers a window to the exciting world of motorsport, while still holding onto its approachable attributes. The past few years have seen our global race offering thrive, with 12 official Radical championships now operating worldwide. Therefore, there was no better time than now to develop and improve the SR1, to provide these aspiring racers with a chance to race at bucket-list tracks all over the world. After the launch of SR3 XXR and SR10 XXR, it was only right to align the SR1 under the XXR banner too, as, after all, it has proven to be the pillar of our company ethos – we make racers.”</p>\n\n<p>The updated SR1 XXR is available to order now through Radical Motorsport’s global dealer network, operational through over 30 dealers in more than 20 countries, with production expected to begin later in Summer 2023. Meanwhile, customers of SR3 XXR have started to see their cars, as production commenced in early February 2023.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-ENDS-</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>NOTES TO EDITORS</h3>\n\n<p><em>Radical Motorsport enjoyed unprecedented growth in its 25th year, building and selling more cars in 2022 than at any other time in its history.

          "content": "<p>Harper-Ellam came into the weekend with the momentum, after two wins last time out at Cadwell Park trimmed his deficit to championship leader James Pinkerton to just 26 points.</p>\n\n<p>However, an accidental clash between the two dealt a damaging blow to Harper-Ellam’s title hopes, with the ultra-consistent Pinkerton salvaging two second places to extend his advantage ahead of the final two races at Brands Hatch in November. Patrick Lay was the other star of the weekend, taking a stunning win from his first ever car race, before capping his one-off outing with a race two podium.</p>\n\n<p>Harper-Ellam’s weekend started well, with him securing double pole positions to continue his 100 per cent qualifying record this season.</p>\n\n<p>However, the race would hold worse fortunes. Harper-Ellam lost vital ground in the points with an unfortunate retirement, after the two title rivals accidentally came to blows. The chaos allowed the impressive Lay to bag his first ever car racing victory.</p>\n\n<p>Rain began to lash the circuit just as the field went off for its green flag lap, with Harper- Ellam leading the pack around. However, when the lights went out, Pinkerton managed to slither into the lead ahead of Harper-Ellam and Lay, as the top three soon began to make a break.</p>\n\n<p>Lay’s karting background meant he took to the tricky conditions brilliantly, nosing into the lead on lap three and then not looking back. Things were tougher for Pinkerton and Harper-Ellam, who were both running wet Hankooks but with dry setups. Pinkerton spun out at the start of lap four, and the unfortunate Harper-Ellam just couldn’t avoid him. The front of Pinkerton’s car gouged the radiator on the left-hand side of Harper-Ellam’s, putting him out on the spot.</p>\n\n<p>Things got even trickier as the conditions worsened later in the race, with the outing eventually ending under the safety car as Lay ran out a comfortable winner, well ahead of Pinkerton.</p>\n\n<p>Will Hunt secured another outright podium finish after holding on in a tight tussle with Rookie Class rival Chris Short. Short hounded Hunt for the entire race, until a spin on the final lap cost him dearly.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Williams picked up fourth place ahead of newcomers Shane Stoney and Dean Warriner. David Tagg secured his maiden Fangio Trophy victory after outlasting his rivals to take 11<sup>th</sup> overall.</p>\n\n<p>Race two was more serene, and played right into Harper-Ellam’s hands. With his car repaired, he got away well on the rolling start and never looked back for the duration of dry outing.</p>\n\n<p>Pinkerton stayed with the leader, trading fastest laps until the end, but a slide at Redgate and a momentary gearbox glitch cost him valuable time and limited him to second.</p>\n\n<p>Lay put in a fine drive to finish third, holding off the charging Stoney, who clung to his gearbox throughout.</p>\n\n<p>After his late race one retirement, Short lifted the Rookie Class win in fifth place, which turned out to be crucial to his class title hopes as Hunt had a shocker. He started on wet tyres, but when the rain didn’t arrive he was limited to ninth.</p>\n\n<p>Tagg again won the Fangio Trophy category, leading Paul Clark and Peter Devlin home.</p>\n\n<p>Harper-Ellam may have proven himself the fastest driver this year, but regardless will trail Pinkerton by 55 points heading to the season finale. “I know I’ve got work to do, so I’ll be full attack at Brands,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Game on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver quotes:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Patrick Lay:</strong></p>\n\n<p>“The win in race one is a bit hard to believe! I haven’t raced anything for two years after leaving the BirelART karting class, so to win this at the first attempt is a dream result. These cars are just so much fun, and I really liked the feeling in the wet – it was just like karting. To have the podium in race two was brilliant too. I had a great fight with Shane [Stoney], who pushed me all the way. I’d love to come back out, but currently it’s a one-off deal.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>James Pinkerton:</strong></p>\n\n<p>“Second in race one was a good result, but this is not the way I wanted to extend a championship lead. I feel so sorry for Ryan, but I just lost the car in the slippery conditions and there was nothing I could do. I won’t lie, I wanted the win in race two and I pushed hard for it, but I got a big slide on at Redgate that cost me and then got a box of neutrals coming out of the final corner, but luckily it cleared itself. I’ll be looking to attack at Brands, as bad things usually happen when you back off.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ryan Harper-Ellam: </strong></p>\n\n<p>“It’s been a really hard weekend, with lots of ups and down. I was gutted after race one, and it’s also cost me dearly in the championship, but I believe James couldn’t do much about it and it’s just bad luck. We’ve shaken hands over it and we’ll move on. Race two went exactly to plan. The title fight is pretty much out of my hands. All I can do is try to win all of the remaining races. But on the plus side the car felt great and the Radical engineers worked wonders to get me out for race two and keep me in the hunt.”</p>"

          "content": "<p>Organised by Bushy Park Motor Sports Inc (BPMSI), the race programme will run under the all-arena lighting from 5.00pm on Saturday evening, with a day-time schedule from Noon on Sunday; all races will start from the southern grid, known to promote close and exciting racing. With the regional Suzuki Challenge Series at the end of its projected three-year cycle, racing for the Suzuki-powered Radical SR3 sports cars continues under the wing of BPMSI.</p>\n\n<p>A seven-year veteran of various Radical campaigns, Marateotto won the European Masters title in both 2015 and 2016, claiming 14 wins from the 33 races over the two seasons, along with 10 further podium finishes, one pole position start and a fastest lap. In 2014, he gained unwanted fame when a puncture at the legendary Eau Rouge corner at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium catapulted his Radical into the barriers, narrowly missing spectators and a marshals post; testament to the strength of the Radial SR3, however, he was released from hospital after an overnight stay.</p>\n\n<p>More recently Marateotto has dovetailed Radical commitments with outings in the LMP3 classes of the European Le Mans Series and Michelin Le Mans Cup in a Judd-engined Oreca and, more recently a Ligier JS P3 with Nissan power, as well as previous outings with Race Performance in LMP2.</p>\n\n<p>British driver Mark Crader was a motor racing novice when he first competed in the SR1 Cup in 2013 and has raced Radicals ever since, upgrading to the SR3 RS in 2015. Since then he has been a regular competitor in the UK-based Sprint and Enduro Championships, also taking in rounds of the Radical European Masters, which is currently the company’s premier International Championship; he claimed class wins at Barcelona in Spain and the Hungaroring in Hungary last year. He will compete in both the UK-based Radical Challenge and the European Masters again in 2018, driving SR3 RSX and SR8 respectively.</p>\n\n<p>On his way to finishing eighth in the Radical Challenge in the UK last year, with a best result of second on the Brands Hatch GP circuit, he regularly raced against drivers familiar to island fans, not only Bajans Mark and Stuart Maloney, but also British brothers Brian and John Caudwell and teenager Jack Manchester, who have raced at Bushy Park over the past couple of seasons.</p>\n\n<p>Double Suzuki Challenge Series Champion Sol Esuf will lead the ‘home team’ in this weekend’s events, along with inaugural Champion Sean Maloney, who won the title in 2015-16, and fellow race-winners Mark and Stuart Maloney and David Simpson.</p>\n\n<p>Demonstrations on both two and four wheels from the growing number of patrons who have enjoyed Bushy Park Circuit Inc (BPCI) Track Days over the past two years will be interspersed with the Radical races. BPCI Operations Manager Amy Willis said: <em>“We are hoping to encourage some of our Track Day regulars to take the next step and join BPMSI to start circuit racing, so the first move would be to involve them in a race meeting, so they can see how it all works.”</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical International</strong></p>\n\n<p>Saturday, January 27, 5.00 to 9.00pm: viewing from Open Air Suites only, access through Gate 1 (opens at 4.30pm) - $10.

          "content": "<p><strong>January 4, 2023</strong>&nbsp;– After announcing his return to the USF2000 Series Presented by Cooper Tires with his new team at VRD Racing in 2023, Danny Dyszelski is doubling up on his race efforts by running in the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America series. Joining Wisko Racing competing in the Pro 1500 class, Dyszelski will look to build upon his Radical World Finals second-place finish this past November during his debut in Radical Cup racing.</p>\n\n<p>“As a racer, I always want to race to compete for top finishes and with two competitive programs, the calendar is filling up quickly for the 2023 season,” expressed Dyszelski. “I will prioritize my USF2000 efforts when there is a conflict between the two series, but I will be aiming high in Radical Cup competition and going for race wins and podium results in every event with my main goal of becoming the Radical World Finals Champion.”</p>\n\n<p>Beginning his motorsports career at the age of four, Dyszelski, who hails from South Carolina, has progressed through the karting ranks earning race wins and championships along the way. 2023 will provide new opportunities for the 14-year-old as he will expand his race knowledge and experience while running a full race schedule in both open-wheel and sports car racing as he looks to climb the ladder to the upper echelon of motorsports in North America.</p>\n\n<p>Joining the Radical Cup program with Wisko Racing, Dyzelski enters a program that knows how to win at every level. Located trackside at the Virginia International Raceway, Wisko Racing is one of the dominant programs in the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America program and the premier Radical Cup dealer in the eastern half of the country.</p>\n\n<p>“We are excited to have Danny as part of our efforts in 2023,” explained Danyel Delgado of Wisko Racing. “Danny has proven his speed in all forms of motorsports and was quite impressive at the Spring Mountain Motor Resort during the Radical World Finals ultimately ending the event as the Vice-Champion. Working with him in 2023 will strengthen his abilities on track, and we think that he can be a force every time he climbs behind the wheel of one of our race cars.”</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/915/original/23-01-02-dyszelski1.jpg?1672931119 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/915/std/23-01-02-dyszelski1.jpg?1672931119\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/915/std/23-01-02-dyszelski1.jpg?1672931119\"></p>\n\n<p>Dyszelski added, “I am starting to realize my goal to become a professional driver, and it is driving me to work hard to be the best driver I can be in the world of motorsports. I am confident that running in both series in 2023 will accelerate my development as a professional driver, and I can’t wait to get started with Wisko Racing, VRD Racing, and to run select events with DDR’s new Radicals out of our race shop.”</p>\n\n<p><em>For more information on Danny Dyszelski, please visit him online at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.DannyDRacing.com\">www.DannyDRacing.com</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>For more information on Danny Dyszelski Racing and to find information on how to be involved with their race programs, please feel free to contact Ron Skufca via email at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:Ron@DannyDRacing.com\">Ron@DannyDRacing.com</a>.</em></p>"

          "content": "<p>The championship’s revised new format, with two extended endurance races on top of a 20-minute sprint, has attracted a growing grid of returning champions and seasoned racers, plus new teams and drivers. The second round entry list also shows the global appeal of the SR3 RSX sports prototype, with drivers hailing from France, Germany, Iceland and Switzerland entering the UK’s fastest domestic single-make series at Snetterton.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Reigning champion Dominik Jackson got his title defence off to a flying start at Donington Park, winning both of the higher point-scoring 50-minute endurance races and adding a second place in the sprint. But the RAW Motorsport ace faced plenty of stiff opposition sharing the podium honours.</p>\n\n<p>Former SR1 Cup Champion Jérôme de Sadeleer claimed the sprint race spoils amid a clean sweep of second and third place podiums to sit second to Jackson in the standings. His 360 Racing teammate Mark Richards showed race-winning potential and notched up a pair of third places, but missing Snetterton means he’ll be playing catch-up at Spa-Francorchamps next month.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson may have predicted strong opposition from de Sadeleer and Richards, but a fresh rival emerged from the opening round battles. Hart GT’s Jac Constable impressed on his race debut and switch from the TOCA paddock. Bagging a pair of fourth places before earning his first series podium in race three, the newcomer lies third in the title fight.</p>\n\n<p>“We had a pretty good first round at Donington Park with three solid results and we improved a lot over the weekend,” comments the 21 year-old Fix Auto UK-backed driver. “I wasn’t expecting to get a podium at the first round, but it’s a great thing to tick off early-on! We now know what we’ve got in the bag, and there’s more to come from me and the car, but we’ve already made good progress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Fighting for the title was a long-term rather than short-term goal, so it’s great to be up the front from the start. I like Snetterton and we had a good run there in the pre-season test. We know everything can change come the race weekend so we’ll take it as it comes, but I’ll be aiming for more podiums.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Brian Murphy and his privateer Orwin Racing team are threatening for top-three status this term, having twice finished just outside a podium-paying result last month. Elliot Goodman, John MacLeod, Brian Caudwell, Spencer Bourne and Jason Rishover also established themselves within top six contention.</p>\n\n<p>More new faces are welcomed to the Challenge fold for round two. Auõunn Guõmundsson, who comes to the series via Radical’s Icelandic dealer, will make his SR3 race debut with the Works team. A rapid and experienced track day driver, Auõunn is looking forward to racing on UK soil, and says: “Since I was 14 years old, I have always wanted to race on asphalt and there is no track in Iceland. I have owned a Radical SR3 for a number of years and done lots of track days, now I want to see how I do in competition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“My first pre-season test at Snetterton went well and, with some good support from Radical, I was able to improve and do much better than I expected driving there for the first time. The car has excellent balance and is great value for money. My goal for Snetterton is to get some experience before we race at Spa-Francorchamps next month, and to enjoy it!”</p>\n\n<p>Returning to racing for the first time in four years, Guillaume Gruchet will also make his Radical Challenge debut. The former Britcar and Porsche racer will contest select 2019 rounds with international race and championship-winning team, Newbridge Motorsport.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Radical Challenge action starts at Snetterton with qualifying at 09.25 on Saturday 11 May, followed by a 50-minute endurance race at 12.35 and 20-minute sprint at 16:25.&nbsp;Live timing is available via <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.tsl-timing.com</a>. Race highlights will also be available from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/radicalsportscars/\" target=\"_blank\">Radical Sportscars Facebook</a> page, and via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/RadicalSportscarsUK\" target=\"_blank\">Radical TV </a>YouTube channel.</p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Bucharest, January 15th:</strong>&nbsp;This Sunday marks the beginning of a new series aimed for convergence between the virtual scene and the real thrill of the racetracks. Radical Romania supports the inception of an iRacing initiative launched by Racing League Romania, a structure with more than 10 years of experience in organizing sim racing championships. The new concept bears the name of RLR Radical Sprint Cup.</p>\n\n<p>The season schedule includes 10 sprint events, each comprised of two heats. Over 60 contestants have registered already, fighting for a place on the 30-car grid that gets generous exposure on TV and stream. The Sunday evening show begins with a 10-minute qualifying session, followed by a 40-minute Feature Race with mandatory pitstop. The top 10 finishers are then reversed on the grid for the 25-minute Sprint Race that follows.</p>\n\n<p>There will be an individual classification for drivers that determines the inaugural RLR Radical Sprint Cup champion in May. Sim racers will also be in the fight for separate standings reserved for real life racers and iRacing platform rookies. Radical Romania instructors are also joining the party, being avid sim racers with a history in the RLR environment.</p>\n\n<p>The ”Holy Grail” of transitioning from simulator to real racing also motivates the entire community, as the top 3 in the standings and a random participant will be awarded a chance to shine on Romania's first racing track aboard the Radical SR1. Out of the 4 shootout participants, the skilled winnner will race the SR1 in a round of the national time attack series (ROTAC) with full support from Radical Romania.</p>\n\n<p>”We are delighted to launch the RLR Radical Sprint Cup in winter time, while we are cozy at home, yet buzzing for the return of circuit racing. The level of skill translation between sim racing and real life grows more an more, as the virtual platforms become more and more immersive. Thus, we share the same belief as our Racing League Romania partners that eSports represent a relevant learning path. Enjoy the SR8 battles and keep an eye on those names you see on top!” stated Andrea Fogliazza, General Manager of Radical Romania.</p>\n\n<p>”From Spa-Francorchamps to Sonoma, I’ve enjoyed watching Radical prototypes being pushed to the absolute limit. The lasting excitement made us approach the Radical Romania structure right from day one to develop this virtual bridge together. We are now committed to engage the technical and media resources needed for a spectacular show everytime 30 SR8s roar on the RLR Radical Sprint Cup grid. This is shaping up to be a unique path towards circuit racing, as any Romanian sim racer can register and prove his worth,” added Alexandru Șiclovan, Racing League Romania promoter.</p>\n\n<h2>Calendar&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>The RLR Radical Sprint Cup features 10 rounds, one every two weeks between January 17th and May 24th. The first four racetracks mirror the official iRacing sanctioned ”Radical Racing Challenge” current season. Afterwards, a string of spectacular UK and US circuits make up the rest of the schedule, with the RLR organizers also keeping an eye on keeping the costs of sim racing as affordable as possible. The newly-launched Long Beach street course will certainly be one of the greatest challenges of the season.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Laguna Seca – January 17th<br>\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Road America – February 1st<br>\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sebring – February 14th&nbsp;<br>\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Zolder – February 28th<br>\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Snetterton – March 14th<br>\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oulton Park – March 28th<br>\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Silverstone – April 12th<br>\n8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Donington – April 26th<br>\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long Beach – May 10th<br>\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Watkins Glen – May 24th</p>\n\n<p>West Competition Racing is the promoter of Racing League Romania.</p>\n\n<p>Partners: Radical România, Aqirys, Motul, Textar, MotorPark România, Playseat, Racing Sim, Thrustmaster, Simrace.ro.<br>\nMedia partners: Telekom Sport, Adevărul Auto, Newsweek, 100% Sport, DesignMe, RallyMax, eGames Report.</p>\n\n<p>More about Racing League Romania: facebook.com/Racingleague.Romania.<br>\nAlexandru Șiclovan<br>\n+40729476569<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:alexandru@westcompetition.ro\">alexandru@westcompetition.ro</a></p>"

          "content": "<p>Making his outright racing debut at the iconic Kent track, de Sadeleer got his Radical SR1 Cup campaign off to a flying start with a dominant first career pole position in Saturday qualifying. Setting a blistering time of 1:36.329, he topped the timing screens from lap three of the 20-minute session, initially heading series returnee Richard Baxter before Ellice’s time of 1:37.41 locked out the front row.</p>\n\n<p>A stellar end-of-session charge from Rob Courtneidge secured a second-row starting slot alongside Baxter, while David Thompson’s constant improvement was good enough for fifth fastest with Andrew Ritchie completing the top six for the first race of the season.</p>\n\n<p>The 2017 SR1 Cup field served up a thrilling first round battle around the 2.433-mile Grand Prix circuit in the Sunday morning sunshine, despite a stall from pole-sitter de Sadeleer denying a front-row battle into Paddock Hill Bend. A superb start from Ellice ensured the Radical Works team car led from Baxter and Andy Chittenden heading into Druids for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Last away and some 20 seconds adrift, de Sadeleer mounted a sterling recovery drive. Picking off places to run sixth by the end of lap six, the 360 Racing driver set an outstanding pace on route to claiming a new Radical SR1 Brands Hatch GP lap record of 1:35.867 on lap nine.</p>\n\n<p>With the trio of seasoned SR1 racers evenly matched from the get-go, Baxter and Chittenden afforded Ellice little breathing space and just 1.2 seconds covered the top three four laps in. By mid-distance, the ever-improving pace of Courtneidge and James Pinkerton reeled-in the leaders and, with de Sadeleer refusing to abate his charge, a fierce top-six battle began to unfold.</p>\n\n<p>An off for David Tagg at Westfield and the resulting red flag on lap 11, however, meant the order remained unchanged and Ellice sealed his maiden SR1 Cup victory. He commented: “It was a fantastic race, I really enjoyed that. The guys are quick, there’s only half a second between second to fifth on the grid. I couldn’t afford to make any mistakes. I made a couple and as soon as I did Rich was right there. I was lucky that he had Andy behind him putting him under pressure, so it was a bit cat and mouse. The car is fabulous around here and such good fun to drive.”</p>\n\n<p>For round two on Sunday afternoon, it was SR3 Challenge regular Baxter who made a flying second row start to lead de Sadeleer, Ellice and Thompson before a brave move from the series newcomer at Sheene secured the lead from lap three.</p>\n\n<p>The top two slots seemingly secure, battles raged further down the field, with Ellice fending off Pinkerton’s determined advances for third from lap four. Meanwhile, recovering from a three-place drop at the start, Courtneidge slashed Ritchie’s three second advantage to make a move at Graham Hill Bend for fifth on lap seven.</p>\n\n<p>With the #51 car off at Stirlings the following tour, the resulting safety car period left the closed-up field with a single-lap dash to the chequered flag. The top five cars running line astern at the restart, Baxter took one final shot at the lead to run side-by-side with de Sadeleer into Druids. The Swiss debutant, however, held strong to take what is sure to be the first of many career race wins.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s definitely been a learning curve this weekend, I compared it to playing golf, half the game is in the putt and half the race is in the start!” said de Sadeleer. “I took no risks for the start of race two. I got a good start, lost a couple of places early on, but built up my speed and made a good move to take the lead. I felt the pressure after the safety car period, but managed to defend my line and came home first, so it’s a good day. The car was awesome and the team did a fantastic job preparing it, so everything was wonderful.”</p>\n\n<p>Peter Devlin takes an early lead in the 2017 Fangio Trophy for drivers aged 45 and over. Andy Chittenden and David Tagg are tied for second with Nigel Paine third after two rounds.</p>\n\n<p>For full Radical SR1 race results visit <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com\">www.tsl-timing.com</a></p>"

Field was quickest during the first and final of Friday’s four promoter test day sessions in Jersey with a 1:20.772.</p>\n\n<p>However, Field is just one of multiple drivers looking to take wins and points away from Indy Al Miller (SR10, Blue Marble / ONE Motorsports). Louis Schriber (SR10, Shorewood Development), whose car was fastest in sessions two and three, has arguably been the quickest driver this year, but has seen a spate of bad luck offset a second place at Barber and a win at Road America.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/340/original/Radical-DrewStearne-RaceDay--3.jpg?1630170881 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/340/std/Radical-DrewStearne-RaceDay--3.jpg?1630170881\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/340/std/Radical-DrewStearne-RaceDay--3.jpg?1630170881\"></p>\n\n<p>Another in the Platinum class to look out for will be Judd Miller (SR10, ESSES Racing), who comes into the round on a high after taking the final win of the weekend during the Texan’s home race at COTA.</p>\n\n<p>The PRO 1500 class will also be hotly contested with 22-year-old Pennsylvania native Robert Torres making his debut with Group-A Racing adding another young gun to the entry list. Torres has won three of the four previous races he’s entered at NJMP, but the Radical Cup’s PRO 1500 class is fiercely competitive this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Puerto Rican prodigy Gustavo Rafols (WISKO Racing) leads the points with four wins to his name over storied Radical racer Gregg Gorski (smokebuddy / ONE Motorsports), and another up-and-coming driver Palmer Miller (ESSES Racing).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rafols was quickest in over Friday’s four sessions with a 1:21.279, but Torres’s teammate Steve Jenks (Audien Hearing) hovered near the top of the timesheet all day– including setting the fastest time in session four. Ryan Bjerke (Bjerke Motorsports) also impressed given he’s been on hiatus since last year’s finale at Road Atlanta.</p>\n\n<p>Points leader Mike Anzaldi (Emmett’s Energy / Anzaldi GP) set the benchmark in the PRO 1340 class.</p>\n\n<p>Two more official practice sessions remain before qualifying, Saturday’s Race 1 (3:25 pm EST) and Sunday’s Race 2 (9:40 am EST) and Race 3 (3:40 pm EST).

After a solid start, Anzaldi used his teammate Thomas Paladino, first as a ‘rear gunner’ and then, as the PRO 1500 driver found his rhythm, a ‘rabbit’ to chase, on his way to victory in Race 4 over Reid Stewart. Robert Cipriani (Resicom / Team Stradale) delivered a podium in his first Blue Marble Radical Cup appearance.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/687/original/1340_Steward.JPG?1655194797 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/687/std/1340_Steward.JPG?1655194797\" width=\"399\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/687/std/1340_Steward.JPG?1655194797\"></p>\n\n<p>Driving for the very first time in wet conditions, Cipriani then kept calm amongst the chaos in Race 5 to clinch his first series victory. Visibly emotional on the podium, Cipriani thanked his mother, who he said had made great sacrifices to ensure he could compete. Anzaldi survived two spins on his way to second, while Mike D’Ambrose (Team Stradale) put the squeeze on Austin Riley in the final corner to stay in third.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/691/original/1340_Race_2_Podium.jpg?1655195050 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/691/std/1340_Race_2_Podium.jpg?1655195050\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/691/std/1340_Race_2_Podium.jpg?1655195050\"></p>\n\n<p>Before making contact with the wall Reid Stewart set the fastest lap of the race, but elected to start the final race from pit lane. Disaster struck Rafols on the warm-up lap, with the young Puerto Rican overheating his brakes. Mike Anzaldi made a perfect pitstop to finish the weekend with another win from Austin Riley. Local Mike D’Ambrose picked up another podium, while Cipriani was fourth and Jason Greenwood (AMI Systems / RYNO Racing) fifth.</p>\n\n<h2>PRO 1500</h2>\n\n<p>Reece Everard (Wicked Sweet / Group-A) made his intentions clear, taking the class pole by over six tenths, to tie on points with arch-rival Gustavo Rafols (WISKO Racing) heading into the first race. After patiently backing out of a pass on Everard at Canada corner, a few laps later Rafols daringly tried the outside at Turn. Initially it appeared Rafols had made it stick, but losing traction on the exit allowed Everard back through, and Nate Smith (Lagersmith / RYNO Racing) too. Losing time in the carousel Rafols seemed to get stuck behind second placed Smith and had to defend a hard charging Palmer Miller (ESSES Racing) to take third. Taking the top step of the podium Everard broke the news that he’d lost fifth gear early on and had nursed the car to victory lane.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/689/original/1500_Derize_Rafols.jpg?1655194798 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/689/std/1500_Derize_Rafols.jpg?1655194798\" width=\"400\" height=\"252\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/689/std/1500_Derize_Rafols.jpg?1655194798\"></p>\n\n<p>While Smith started the second race from the class pole, disaster struck Rafols, who overcooked a new set of pads on the second warm-up lap. Into Turn 6 on the opening tour, Smith lost the backend all by himself, but was soon collected by Everard, who had to retire with damage. Soon after Smith became a victim of the deteriorating conditions, as did a number of PRO 1500 drivers before a red flag allowed the field to swap to wets. Kent Myers (Esses Racing) survived a two-lap shootout to take second, as did Jack Yang in third– their first ever Radical Cup podiums. Never putting a foot wrong after inheriting the lead on the opening lap, Palmer Miller drove an outstanding race to take his first victory of the season.</p>\n\n<p>A fastest lap for Miller also meant he started Race 6 of the championship from the class pole, however it was Everard who led heading into the pit window. Stellar in and out laps leapfrogged Gustavo Rafols into the win, ahead of Reece Everard. Palmer Miller finished third, with Alain Derzie (ONE Motorsports) finishing a strong fourth, Thomas Palladino fifth and Kent Myers sixth.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/688/original/1500_and_pack.JPG?1655194797 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/688/std/1500_and_pack.JPG?1655194797\" width=\"399\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/688/std/1500_and_pack.JPG?1655194797\"></p>\n\n<h2>PLATINUM</h2>\n\n<p>Louis Schriber III (Shorewood / RYNO Racing) came into his home weekend determined make up for last year, when issues and a bad pit stop strategy robbed him of victories. With English Radical expert Rob Whelden on hand as coach, Schriber made his intentions clear in qualifying, setting a 2:07.374 to eclipse Steve Jenks (Audien Hearing / Group-A) by a mere nine one-hundredths of a second to secure the Motul Pole Award.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/690/original/PLAT_Miller_Schriber_.jpg?1655194800 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/690/std/PLAT_Miller_Schriber_.jpg?1655194800\" width=\"400\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/690/std/PLAT_Miller_Schriber_.jpg?1655194800\"></p>\n\n<p>However by Turn 1 Schriber had been relegated to sixth. Meanwhile reigning class champ Indy Al Miller (Blue Marble / ONE Motorsport), who started fourth, rocketed up to second behind Jenks. As they approached Turn 2 on the second lap, Jenks defended as Miller went for the lead before Miller, in a classic ‘under-over’ fired it down the inside of Turn 6 in the defining move of the race. Miller took the victory from Jenks, and a recovering Schriber. Jon Field (Bricker Home Design / SWR) secured the Sunoco Hard Charger award after working his way up from the back of the grid to fourth, aided in part by a retiring Judd Miller (ESSES Racing).</p>\n\n<p>Bad luck struck Miller again in Race 5, as his car ground to a halt before he could even take the green. After setting fastest lap Jenks started from the pole and he immediately took control of the race, while Miller had contact with Field and Schriber through Turn 5. A lap later Schriber got ahead of Miller in five, before Miller had to retire after slapping the wall at the Kick.</p>\n\n<p>As the rain came down Field overtook Jenks, who dropped back again as Rossi (Carpet Giant / WISKO Racing) stormed up to second in the worsening conditions. Jenks then spun to fall down the order further before the red flag came out. Field led as the green flag flew once again, but had a moment on the exit of Turn 1 allowing Schriber past. Then on the final lap Schriber ran wide at five to let Rossi through for an outstanding maiden victory, and Field into second. Schriber had to settle for third, until a post race investigation found Rossi had passed Schriber under yellow, relegating him to third, and promoting Field to the win from Schriber. Clint Field (Bricker Home Design / SWR) received the Sunoco Hard Charger award.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/693/original/PLAT_Race_2_Podium.jpg?1655195050 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/693/std/PLAT_Race_2_Podium.jpg?1655195050\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/693/std/PLAT_Race_2_Podium.jpg?1655195050\"></p>\n\n<p>Jon Field started Race 6 from the pole alongside Schriber, who quickly found himself in fourth after Rossi charged through to second and Al Miller barged past. Field was then assisted into a spin, allowing Schriber and Miller duked it out for second behind Rossi, who built up a commanding lead. However, an issue in the front left for Al Miller, the round of mandatory pitstops, and an issue for Rossi on the final tour propelled Judd Miller into a well deserved win, from Scott Wagner and Jon Field. Wagner was later penalized for shorting the stop, relegating him to third and Field into second. Clint Field was fourth, from Claus Nielsen (ESSES Racing), while Schriber came home in sixth.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/694/original/PLAT_Race_3_Podium.jpg?1655195052 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/694/std/PLAT_Race_3_Podium.jpg?1655195052\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/694/std/PLAT_Race_3_Podium.jpg?1655195052\"></p>\n\n<p>The Blue Marble Radical Cup North America series now heads to Watkins Glen, where it will join Masters Historic Formula 1 cars during the Finger Lakes Wine Festival, July 7-10.</p>\n\n<h2>Race 4 Livestream:</h2>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSq2Fwic7N4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>Race 5 Livestream:</h2>\n\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZfKPsawgR-U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://files.usacnation.com/2022/Radical%20Cup%20North%20America/2%20Road%20America\">ROUND 2 RESULTS</a>"

Radical’s new-for-2019 Rapture road-legal track car will also be present to sample for the first time at a UK event since its global dynamic launch at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July.</p>\n\n<p>Hosted from Radical’s MSDLive garage in The Wing, aspiring competitors can sample cars on the International Circuit and visit the Radical Race Centre in full set-up for an authentic taste of its trackside hospitality facility.</p>\n\n<p>A limited number of test drive slots are available throughout the two-day event at a cost of £99 plus VAT. To book your experience, register your interest by completing the form at <a href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/radical-experience/motorsportdayslive\">https://www.radicalsportscars.com/radical-experience/motorsportdayslive</a></p>\n\n<p>With ultra-competitive single-make racing championships operating across four continents, Radical offers a progressive ladder to accessible prototype sportscar racing. Entering at the SR1 Cup, drivers can climb the ranks with the fiercely competitive SR3, the world’s best-selling racecar with over 1,200 in market, right through to international competition with the RXC Spyder and SR8.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you are looking to take the first step into racing and want to utilise Radical’s fully supported new driver programme - taking you from ARDS licence attainment through to bespoke driver coaching and your competition debut - or looking for a fresh new racing challenge, there’ll be no shortage of experts on-hand to give all the advice you need to get on track in the UK and across the globe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Radical’s official championships go from strength-to-strength, the unrivalled level of competition and consistently healthy grids continuing to draw wider appeal. A record number of drivers migrated to the SR1 Cup and Radical Challenge from a plethora of other top series in 2019, including from Ginetta and Renault Clios, whilst no fewer than 12 new teams offered the prospective competitor an even greater choice of options.</p>\n\n<p>The SR1 Cup continues to prove its winning multi-class formula as the UK’s leading entry level sports prototype racing series. The Rookie Cup for the novice racer and Fangio Trophy, for drivers aged 40 years or over, attract ever-increasing grids of newcomers, karting graduates and seasoned drivers of all ages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Radical Challenge, home to the SR3 RSX, continues to be one of the UK’s fastest single-make championships, its completely level playing field of drivers returning for battle year-on-year and raft of new racing talent helping grids to edge close to 30 cars this season.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In addition to showcasing its 2020 format for the SR1 Cup and Radical Challenge championships, Radical will also unveil its newly expanded international winter testing and racing programme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Recently launched by Radical Iberia, the Nevada Cup is an informal and friendly series offering a mix of open-pitlane testing and racing across a four-round calendar of circuits in Andalucía, Spain. The seven-round Gulf Radical Cup also returns for the 13th year. Staged at the Yas Marina and Dubai Autodrome circuits from October to March it makes for an appealing overseas destination for SR3 drivers and their families.</p>\n\n<p>This year also brought the launch of Radical’s new road-legal Rapture. True to its format as a race car for the road, the Rapture generates extreme performance via lightweight construction combined with aerodynamic efficiency. No other street-legal car available today offers the same percentage of race-bred DNA, making it the ideal choice for customers seeking a raw, exhilarating driving experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Radical’s attendance at the first MotorsportDays LIVE in 2018 was a resounding success and we look forward to welcoming more drivers to our unique product and championship offering this year,” said Marketing Manager, Will Brown. “Our test drives at last years’ event generated sales for SR1, SR3 and RXCs from across the world. There’s still a limited number of test drive spaces available so don’t miss out – visit the Radical garage to discuss your 2020 track and racing options, and how to get on-track with Radical.”</p>\n\n<p>Europe’s only on-track trade event, MotorsportDays LIVE offers genuine track day enthusiasts, amateur and professional race drivers, performance car buyers and industry professionals a fresh opportunity to source products from an array of diverse exhibitors, network with race teams, championships and manufacturers, and actually sample cars and products ‘LIVE’ on Silverstone’s International Circuit.</p>\n\n<p>For further event and ticket information visit <a href=\"https://www.motorsportdays.live\">https://www.motorsportdays.live</a></p>"

As Radical Caribbean, we will now be handing all the sales for Radical vehicles and parts for the region, along with providing services such as technical support and engine rebuilds. We are thrilled to be the regional dealer for Radical and are looking forward to seeing this series develop in the Caribbean.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Radical Sportscars Sales &amp; Marketing Director Nigel Land said: <em>“We’re delighted to appoint Bushy Park as the sole distributor for Caribbean. The incredible circuit in Barbados provides an excellent base from which to promote Radical and support all of our customers across the region. We have been working with the team for many years both as customers and competitors in the European championships, and it is a natural step for us both to formalise this fantastic partnership”.</em></p>\n\n<p>The Radical Carnival in January, which will coincide with Radical’s 21st Anniversary, will also launch Bushy Park’s 2018 season; organised by Bushy Park Motor Sport Inc (BPMSI), the two-day race meet will host the double-header opening round of the fourth Suzuki Challenge Series, with the cars from the Swift Cup joining the Radicals of the SR3 Cup. The Saturday races will run under the recently-installed all-arena lighting, which was launched at the Barbados Festival of Speed in October.</p>\n\n<p>Based in the East Midlands city of Peterborough, Radical has built more than 2,000 cars, progressing from the iconic Clubsport model revealed in early 1996 and which established the company’s reputation, through the SR3, launched in 2002 to the SR8, which brought Le Mans Prototype pace to the national racing scene. Entering 2017, a core range of five models means that Radical caters for a wide audience, with a ladder spanning from the SR1 club racing model through SR3 with over 1,200 racing globally to the 650bhp RXC GT3, suitable for international endurance racing.</p>\n\n<p>In the three seasons since the launch of the Suzuki Challenge Series in Barbados in 2015, 24 drivers from seven nations have competed in 55 SR3 Cup races for Suzuki-powered Radical SR3s at Bushy Park Barbados; at the recent final round of the Seaboard Marine Caribbean Motor Racing Championship (CMRC) in Guyana, three of the cars shipped home by their Guyanese owners drove the first demonstration laps of the South Dakota circuit. In addition, two of Jamaica’s most accomplished drivers, Kyle Gregg and David Summerbell Jnr, have acquired an RXC and SR8 respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Regional drivers have also travelled to race in other Radical series; from Barbados, Mark, Sean and Stuart Maloney and David Simpson have raced at leading British circuits, including Brands Hatch and Silverstone, while Guyana’s Kristian Jeffrey contested the whole of the UK-based Radical Challenge Championship, including the overseas races, in 2017. In his first season competing away from home in the highly competitive Radical Challenge which regularly has grids of greater than 30 cars, he finished the season in 5th overall, with a number of podium places including 2nd at Rockingham and the season finale at Snetterton 300.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on Bushy Park Barbados:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bushyparkbarbados.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.bushyparkbarbados.com</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BushyParkBarbados/?ref=nf&amp;hc_ref=ARQhVo56VeDo2hzS1ZdXlCMIMMF9HGOxDA96tnb1-FwVtC6DBzDLQ7hwONZ_w5CTOnY\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook.com/BushyParkBarbados</a></p>\n\n<p>For further media information, contact Bushy Park Barbados Media Team:</p>\n\n<p>e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:media@bushyparkbarbados.com\">media@bushyparkbarbados.com</a></p>"

Entering their 25th year, new updates were announced in December for the iconic Radical SR3 XX and the turbocharged Radical SR10. The latter also soon became the fastest-selling model in Radical’s history. The company’s on-track offering continued to grow as well, with the UK’s Radical Challenge Championship enjoying some of the largest grids its seen, and the Radical Cup North America entertained sell-out crowds alongside the NTT IndyCar series once again.</p>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport is represented globally by a network of 33 dealers in 21 different countries, who aim to make Radical’s ‘Race the World’ mission a reality. Radical’s dealer network offer sales and trackside support for the full Radical range, from the entry-level SR1 to the flagship LMP-inspired RXC, and they facilitate ‘arrive and drive’ programs across track days, test and race events.</p>\n\n<h2>Radical Midwest Team Stradale and Radical Northwest Award Motorsport Tie for Dealer of the Year, North America</h2>\n\n<p>Radical Midwest, based at Autobahn Country Club in Illinois, and Radical Northwest at Sonoma Raceway, California, tied for the 2021 Dealer of the Year award for North America.</p>\n\n<p>Team Stradale were appointed as the Midwestern distributor for Radical in 2013, and quickly became the fastest-growing dealer in the US. Spearheaded by Francesco D’Avola and operating from an impressive facility at the Autobahn Country Club circuit near Chicago, Team Stradale have been instrumental in making Radical the track car of choice for club members. The team have also found great success in the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America, with drivers Alex Morton, a former Team USA cyclocross champion, and emerging star Christian Weir finding race and championship success in their debut Radical seasons.</p>\n\n<p>The impressive performance over the past eight years is set to continue, with Team Stradale recently being appointed as Radical’s official dealer in Florida – the first to represent Radical in the region.

They’ve hosted a series of free ‘Under Lights’ community events at their headquarters, and at one event, even pitting the Radical SR10 against a McLaren Senna GTR.</p>\n\n<p>Arise Racing also runs a young driver development program and has been instrumental in the rebirth of the Radical Cup Australia, which takes place in five of Australia’s premier circuits for the first time in 2022. The first round at the famous Phillip Island circuit saw Arise Racing fielding five cars, with General Manager Jordan Oon claiming pole position in qualifying and the race three win.</p>\n\n<h2>Radical AZ Apex Motor Club, Radical Sweden and Radical Australia East GWR also enjoy accolades in 2021 awards</h2>\n\n<p>Radical’s Dealer of the Year awards are designed to recognise the entire performance of standout dealers both on and off the track, with a pair of secondary awards marking notable performance in other areas.</p>\n\n<p>Radical AZ, based at the Apex Motor Club private member’s club in Arizona, has won the Fastest Lap Award for North America, with Radical Sweden winning the award for the Rest of World region.</p>\n\n<p>In a sustained standout performance, Radical Midwest Team Stradale also won the Constructor Award for North America, with Sydney’s Radical Australia East Garth Walden Racing claiming the Rest of World prize.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking at Radical Motorsport’s Cambridgeshire headquarters, Group Sales and Marketing Director Dan Redpath, said:</p>\n\n<p>“Radical’s global dealer network is the cornerstone of our business, so it’s brilliant to be able to recognise their contributions to what has been the most successful year for Radical in the company’s entire 25-year history.</p>\n\n<p>“We built more cars in 2021 than at any other point in our history, and as we celebrate our 25th anniversary this year, the outstanding performance of our dealers supports the company’s ambitious growth strategy.</p>\n\n<p>“Francesco and his team in Illinois have really outdone themselves, and we’ve strengthened our relationship with Team Stradale by appointing them as our dealers in Miami.</p>\n\n<p>“Anthony and Steve as Radical Northwest sold our 50th SR10 and have been doing some brilliant work for us in California, and the energy from Jordan and his team at Arise Racing has been recognised around the world.</p>\n\n<p>“I would like to extend my personal thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worked so hard in 2021 as we rebounded from the various global lockdowns, and I am excited to see what we can achieve together as we look forward to the next 25 years.”</p>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport congratulates all its dealer around the world for achieving strong results in often turbulent market conditions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTES TO EDITORS</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Radical Motorsport Ltd.

          "content": "<p>No fewer than three former champions are set to return to the fold this term. Former triple title winner Peter Paddon comes into the event as the most successful competitor on the mountain, although he won’t have things all his own way with the return of fellow three-time champion Neale Muston. Muston hasn’t been a full-time competitor in the Cup since his title-winning run in 2015 (in a Radical SR8), and he’s not won on the mountain in an SR3 whilst Paddon has seven wins in the four-cylinder variant, from his last eight starts!<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nAnother champion returning to the fray is Sydney’s Ed Singleton, reigning Heritage Touring Cars Group C Champion, who is back behind the wheel of an SR3 RS, similar to the car that took him to the 2011 Cup title.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nSingleton, Muston and Paddon will form part of a 22-driver field that also includes a couple of drivers with some serious miles under their belts at Mount Panorama, one of them a Gold Logie recipient..!<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nFormer Supercar and GT driver Grant Denyer - these days more at home in front of a camera - will join GT3 regular Brad Shiels in a Radical SR3 RS campaigned by the Bathurst-based Pennells family. While Denyer will be looking to put his extensive Bathurst experience to good use, David Pennells joins fellow local Matthew Windsor to complete the two-car team.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThey won’t be the only Bathurst Radical rookies in the field either, with 16-year old West Australian Aaron Love - who claimed third in the 2018 Australian Formula 4 Championship alongside his title win in the WA F1000 Championship (where he claimed an impressive 12 wins from 21 starts) - joining the field. Set to become the youngest driver to have ever competed in a Radical SR3 at Mount Panorama, Love comes into the Bathurst event looking to make an impression.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nHe won’t be the only one though, 2018 Radical Australia Cup rookie sensation Chris Perini showed flashes of brilliance at Mount Panorama last year, famously pushing ‘Peter Perfect’ Paddon all the way in the opening race before a race-ending off going over Skyline in race two blemished an almost perfect mountain debut.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nPerini was consistently 2018 champion, Kim Burke’s toughest opponent across the year, the former Superbike rider admitting that the lost opportunity at Bathurst may have kept him from the #1 plate. So he’s keen to impress upon his rivals the lessons he learned last term, a season which delivered the RAC rookie victories at The Bend and Sydney Motorsport Park.</p>\n\n<p>Another driver that could be expected to shake up the establishment is former Radical Australia Cup regular Kostinken Pohorukov. A frequent podium finisher back in 2016 - including two second-placed finishes at Bathurst behind Paddon - ‘Kosta’ has been on a sabbatical from regular competition over the last two seasons, but is back for 2019 with the ex-David Crampton SR3 RSX, and ready to take the fight to the contenders.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst the new and returning stars will make things interesting, so too will the RAC regulars who have their own scores to settle with the mountain...<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nSimon Haggarty returns after missing the Bathurst round last year, the HRT driver looking to make amends for his last race at the mountain which ended quite unceremoniously on the exit of the first corner. Despite a part season last year, Haggarty still delivered a win at Sandown and he’ll be a likely contender at Bathurst.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nSo too 2017 ‘Rookie of the Year’ pairing Brad and Mitch Neilson, the father and son team claimed a win at The Bend last season on their way to third in the points. Although the Mount Panorama newcomers will be on a ‘steep’ learning curve come Thursday morning, the #38 machine is bound to make its presence felt.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nMichael Whiting returns looking to silence the demons that caught him out twice on the opening lap of last year’s races, where despite his bad luck he was one of the fastest drivers on track, impressively working his way forward to sixth in race one. Joined by Chris Medland, Greg Kenny, Rowan Ross and Bill Medland, they will all be right in the mix as the new Radical recruits find their feet.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nAnthony Davis returns for 2019 after a cameo with David Crampton last year, campaigning the car he runs regularly on track days with father George, whilst former GT driver Brenton Griguol will make his debut in an all-new SR3 RSX run by South Australia’s experienced BRM outfit, the Adelaide-based team also running Aaron Love.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nFor Radical Australia’s Chris Medland, the Bathurst driver line-up is a great start to the new season, a season which will see a revised programme of events spread across both the CAMS Nationals and the Australian Production Car Championships.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n“We’ve restructured the calendar to take in two rounds at Sydney Motorsport Park - which is where Radical is based, a return to The Bend - which was incredibly popular last year, Phillip Island and Bathurst, whilst our competitors loved closing out the year in past seasons at Highlands, so we’re excited to bring the New Zealand event back for this year,” he explained.</p>\n\n<p>“Bathurst, though, is a fantastic way to start a new season and it always delivers some fantastic results, so to see three former champions in the field looking to open their 2019 account with a win is terrific, whilst we’re also seeing some new teams comes in for the first time, as well as some new cars - it’s going to be a great start to the season!”&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nFor the 2019 season opener, a change in the schedule will allow the Radical teams to turn valuable extra laps in a 20-minute practice session on Thursday morning to dial themselves in ahead of qualifying after lunch, then the opening 45-minute race at 7:15am on Friday morning, the second at 9:45am on Saturday.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nSaturday’s race will be streamed LIVE here: <a href=\"https://www.bathurst12hour.com.au/streams-tv/international-streaming/\">https://www.bathurst12hour.com.au/streams-tv/international-streaming/</a> while you can also follow the action on the Radical Australia Facebook page <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/radicalaustralia\">www.facebook.com/radicalaustralia</a></p>"

The Radical Australia Cup as one element of the program in particular provides a strong championship contested across some of the best circuits in the region, in a car that harks back to an era of real motorsport where electronic driver aids and expensive technology very much played second-fiddle to the drivers themselves.”</p>\n\n<p>Jones will be a regular feature as the face of Radical Australia, and whilst unlikely to jump back behind the wheel, is always ready to offer plenty of advice and experience to the drivers as they extract the maximum from their mighty Radical SR3s, and to assist in sales conversions for new customers, giving them a chance to be involved one-on-one with a legend of world motorsport.</p>\n\n<p>“We’re very excited to invite Alan onboard with Radical Australia,” RA Motorsport’s Chris Medland admitted.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve felt that an important step in the evolution of Radical in Australia is to have an iconic face represent the brand, and what better face than that of an Australian Formula One world champion.</p>\n\n<p>“This has been an important process for us alongside what we have planned for 2018, with the Radical Australia Cup likely to attract record entries with the program we have in place, and with 100 cars now delivered in Australia over the last 11 years, it’s important that we have a solid structure in place to manage that project for the future.”</p>\n\n<p>For RA Motorsports, season 2018 promises to be their biggest season on record, and whilst final details of next year’s program are just weeks away (including final confirmation of the 2018 calendar - which again starts at the Bathurst 12-Hour), there are a million reasons to keep a very close eye on what they have planned.</p>"

Monticello Motor Club members Joe Robillard, Dwight Merriman and Ari Straus punched above their weight in an SR3 RSX 1500 to finish first in the RS3 class and second outright in a field dominated by high-horsepower, high-cost cars such as the outright winning Porsche GT3 Cup and third placed Lamborghini Gallardo Super Trofeo.\nFor much of the race it had looked like the Radical Canada SR3 RS 1340 of Doug Allingham, Alan Shaw and Robert Burgess would contend for the overall win, however contact in the final hour meant they would have to settle with the RS4 class win. Team Stradale’s Eric Wagner and Francesco D’Avola also came away with a podium finish, taking second place in the RS3 class."

          "content": "<p>The world’s most popular sportsracer, Radical’s SR3, again showed its endurance capabilities in Friday’s 90 minute race, with four SR3s finishing in the top ten. Finishing second outright behind an LMP3 machine, Joe Robillard took RS3 honors for Monticello Motor Club and Heinlien Racing Development in an SR3 RSX 1500, while Luis Cordero won the RS4 class and finished fourth overall in his SR3 RSX 1340- a result which helped him earn the weekend’s Star Driver Award. Canadian Bruce McIntyre was the first placed Radical SR8.</p>\n\n<p>Friday was also when Spencer Brockman found the limelight for the first time. An intense qualifying session for Race 1 of the Radical Cup East saw the young American duke it out for top honors in the 1500 class with Scottish pro Stevan McAleer. Brockman’s dominance of the session, until a late run by McAleer sealed the class pole, impressed the paddock, and confirmed the potential Radical Texas see in the young star, who is also racing in the SCCA’s Formula Atlantic class.</p>\n\n<p>Chuck Quinton, in an SR8 RX, led the sixteen car field of Race 1 from start to finish, winning the Masters class from Bruce McIntyre. Brockman, meanwhile, found his way past McAleer in lap one, only to have McAleer repay the favor five laps later. Nevertheless, Brockman kept pushing, setting the fastest 1500 lap of the race on his penultimate tour, earning him class pole for Race 2. McAleer won the 1500 class from Brockman and a fast finishing Richard Thomas– the reigning 1500 Champion and WISKO Racing driver earned the Hard Charger award for storming from the back of the grid to earn a podium place. Antoine Comeau won the 1340 class from Robert Burgess and fellow Team Stradale driver Luis Cordero.</p>\n\n<p>Spencer Brockman shared the front row of the grid with Chuck Quinton for Sunday’s Radical Cup Race 2. While prior commitments kept McAleer from starting, Brockman now had champion Thomas right behind him on the grid. However not even Thomas recording the fastest 1500 lap of the race unsettled Brockman, who drove a textbook race to record his first Radical Cup win during his first ever Radical Cup event. Completing the 1500 podium– to highlight Brockman’s feat even further– was Wisko’s Jim Booth, last year’s European Radical Masters series Fangio Trophy winner.</p>\n\n<p>Chuck Quinton again took the outright win, and another Masters class victory from Floridian Andrew Varona, who impressively carved his way up through the field, and Bruce McIntyre. Antoine Comeau also made it two wins for the weekend, taking the 1340 class victory from Robert Burgess and Eric Wagner. German driver Katarina Kyvalova earned Race 2’s Hard Charger award after working her way from the back of the pack to finish fourth in the 1340 class.</p>\n\n<p>Radical’s next North American race will take place April 7-9 at the famed Road Atlanta circuit in Georgia for the first round of the Radical North American Masters. Like Sebring, this event, which can be entered by privateers and drivers supported by Radical dealers, will feature hospitality and social events to promise a spectacular weekend both on and off the track.

          "content": "<p><strong>Peterborough (UK), Wednesday 22nd&nbsp;March 2023; Radical Motorsport</strong> – the UK’s largest race car manufacturer – is pleased to announce the appointment of Graham Rahal Performance as its new official dealer in Indianapolis, USA.</p>\n\n<p>Owned by NTT INDYCAR Series driver Graham Rahal, Radical USA Indianapolis will operate out of Graham Rahal Performance, in their state-of-the-art facility in Brownsburg, on the outskirts of Indianapolis. First opened in 2017 on the foundations of Graham Rahal’s passion and love for vehicles of all kinds, their state-of-the-art facility now offers a variety of services for any vehicle across Indiana and Ohio. The appointment of GRP as Radical USA Indianapolis builds on the last few years of success and is a well-deserved addition to the strong North American Radical market.</p>\n\n<p>Radical USA Indianapolis will provide an elevated experience for customers of the Radical racing program, motorsport enthusiasts wanting to take the next step in their racing career or those wanting to indulge in their track day hobby. In conjunction with both Graham Rahal Performance and Rahal Paint Protection, Radical USA Indianapolis is now available for prospective and current Radical owners for spare parts, transport, maintenance, wrapping, performance, and sales enquiries across both Ohio and Indiana.</p>\n\n<p>GRP owner Graham Rahal said: “Radical is a highly regarded global motorsport brand, and through our partnership, Radical Indianapolis will be able to provide customers with the best performance for their dollar.&nbsp; Through each stage of our services, the highly skilled team at Radical Indianapolis and Graham Rahal Performance will ensure the racecars are at peak performance when taken to the track, and that the customers have an elevated experience during their time with us. &nbsp;We are excited to add this venture to our growing portfolio.”</p>\n\n<p>With the launch of the latest updates to their most popular models, the SR3 XXR and SR10 XXR, Radical has quickly become the race car of choice for motorsport and car club members wanting faster, more competitive cars. Since it’s inception, Radical Motorsport has sold close to 3,000 cars, with roughly two-thirds of cars being exported to North America.</p>\n\n<p>The appointment of Radical Indianapolis complements the existing Radical dealer network, and is their tenth dealer in North America. The last few years have also seen the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America race series gain popularity, as this season, it supports four IndyCar rounds, including one on the streets of Toronto. The wider, global Radical dealer network includes over 30 dealers serving over 20 countries – all the way from Canada and the US to Europe, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport Business Development Manager Jeff Barrow commented on the appointment, “I have worked with Graham Rahal since his early days in Formula Atlantic, and I’ve watched both Graham and his brands grow to become a staple in motorsports in North America. With GRP being based in Indianapolis, the centre of speed, and Graham’s strong family heritage in Ohio, it made perfect sense to bring his group into the Radical family of dealers. We look forward to working with him and his wider team to solidify Radical as the brand of choice for motor enthusiasts across the States.”</p>\n\n<p>Radical Indianapolis is the latest in a series of new Radical dealer appointments across the globe, with other recent appointments including Germany North, Germany South and Spain.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about GRP and Radical Indianapolis please visit <a href=\"https://radicalindianapolis.com/\">https://radicalindianapolis.com/</a></p>\n\n<h3>NOTES TO EDITORS</h3>\n\n<p><em>Radical Motorsport enjoyed unprecedented growth in its 25th year, building and selling more cars in 2022 than at any other time in its history.

          "content": "<p>Temperatures were rising, and with a busy weekend of racing ahead it was always going be a tough one for all.</p>\n\n<p>While George King had shown initial dominance, and maintained a decent lead in the points table, it was really only Ian Loggie that stood a chance of raining on George's parade! With double points for the last three races, it wasn’t so much about winning, but more about not getting a DNF or letting the other driver steam off ahead with double points.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/584/original/CCK_2651.jpeg?1647877557 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/584/std/CCK_2651.jpeg?1647877557\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/584/std/CCK_2651.jpeg?1647877557\"></p>\n\n<p>So, at 0930 on the Saturday morning it was the first Sprint Race qualifying. This would be the real start to the weekend and see who had the initial pace. It was Ian Loggie Loggie taking Pole for both Sprint Race 1 and 2 with a fastest time of 1.40.087, with George King 0.3 behind and Alex Bukh 0.03 behind that. With a grid of 16 cars, the top 8 were covered by less than a second in qualifying.</p>\n\n<p>Into Sprint 1, and it was George King who got the lead from Loggie with Alex Bukh in third. But on lap 3 the safety car was deployed for a stranded Alex Bukh at turn 14. It seems that he had an issue with the throttle and was stuck after just making contact with the wall. After 5 laps behind safety car the green flags were shown and Loggie was closer than even to King, making a pass on lap 8. In reality all King needed to do was shadow Loggie all weekend to take title and it seemed there as no way either driver was going to allow any mistakes to creep in.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/587/original/CCK_3272.jpeg?1647877559 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/587/std/CCK_3272.jpeg?1647877559\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/587/std/CCK_3272.jpeg?1647877559\"></p>\n\n<p>Newcomer Jacopo Mazza was up to third, with Johnny Khazzoum hot on his heals. But as the race came to an end it was Loggie to take the first win of the weekend, King second and Mazza holding onto third.</p>\n\n<p>With a short gap and it was straight in to Sprint Race 2. Again all cars got around turn 1 safely, but an out of control Bamburg came sliding to Turn 2 (17), clipping the back of Kuwaiti Alkazemi and Roberts, both cars spinning, resulting in a hard impact between Alkazemi and Roberts, taking Alkazemi out of the race. So again the safety car was out while the damaged cars were recovered. Two laps later and it was green again with Loggie leading from Mazza and King.</p>\n\n<p>Impressively, Loggie and Mazza were pulling away from King and finished nose to tail at the 25 minute mark, with King in third, Another step closer sealing the deal!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/591/original/CCK_3606.jpeg?1647877563 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/591/std/CCK_3606.jpeg?1647877563\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/591/std/CCK_3606.jpeg?1647877563\"></p>\n\n<p>That was the first day done, Loggie having all he could to close the gap on King, but with double points all three races on the Sunday the title was still there for the taking.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/590/original/CK_01762.jpeg?1647877563 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/590/std/CK_01762.jpeg?1647877563\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/590/std/CK_01762.jpeg?1647877563\"></p>\n\n<p>The following morning would see back to back Sprint Race and Enduro Race qualifying sessions. This time it was King taking the first Sprint pole with an impressive 1.39.437, with Loggie taking the second Sprint Race pole with a 1.39.657, only 0.001 ahead of King! Once again Bukh was third.</p>\n\n<p>Race start and it was Loggie, from King and Mazza going into the first lap, but Alkazemi had also made a great start getting up to 6th from 8th. But with Roberts slowing, taking avoiding action, Feyzulin was unsighted and crashed into the back of Alkazemi, damaging both cars.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/585/original/CCK_2504.jpeg?1647877556 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/585/std/CCK_2504.jpeg?1647877556\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/585/std/CCK_2504.jpeg?1647877556\"></p>\n\n<p>As the race went on it was Loggie in the lead with King shadowing his every move. It was looking like King wasn’t going to risk a pass, and hoping for Loggie to make a mistake, but that didn’t happen and they finished first and second. With another great podium for Mazza in third.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/588/original/CCK_3369.jpeg?1647877561 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/588/std/CCK_3369.jpeg?1647877561\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/588/std/CCK_3369.jpeg?1647877561\"></p>\n\n<p>The 4th Sprint race of the weekend was not so simple. With a jump start from Alhameedi confusion ensued at the front, King got caught up with another driver allowing Bukh, Mazza and Feyzulin though, dropping Loggie back to 6th. But King re took the lead, and in the possible knowledge of a penalty showed his real pace, pulling way from the rest of the field while Loggie was left battling in the mid pack. He made his way forward but only as good as 4th in the end. Indeed a rare penalty for King was applied, but with the lead that he had built he retained his first win on the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of hours later, and it was the start of the end! The final 45 minute Endurance race of the season. King had no technically done enough to win the series, but had to just see the last race out.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/586/original/CCK_2559.jpeg?1647877559 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/586/std/CCK_2559.jpeg?1647877559\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/586/std/CCK_2559.jpeg?1647877559\"></p>\n\n<p>The race start with King in the lead and Loggie 2nd and Mazza 3rd. With the race progressing Paul Huskinson, who had found great pace all weekend was working his way up the field, overtaking Moorad, Khazzoum and Alkazemi. But at that moment the safety car was out, Feyzulin had attempted a pass into turn 14 and lost control of the car. At the same time the pit stop window was open, meaning cars could pit. All cars except Alkazemi and Bukh did this, a move that would in the end see them right up the front. As all the cars came back out Loggie had a problem, he was stuck in second gear, but was leading the pack, and slowly. Meaning it took a long time to get back to the start where the safety car was waiting to pick them up. However, Loggie pitted again with this terminal failure, meaning Abdulnasser was picked up as the leader. However, by this time Alkazemi and Bukh had been circulating quicker than the rest of the pack and left the pits half a lap ahead on the rest. Meaning that in reality Bukh was in the lead from Alkazemi and then Abdulnaser in third - all very confusing with a lot of head scratching in the pits.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/589/original/CCK_3546.jpeg?1647877563 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/589/std/CCK_3546.jpeg?1647877563\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/589/std/CCK_3546.jpeg?1647877563\"></p>\n\n<p>A few laps later King also pitted with technical issues meaning that as the race played out it was Bukh to take the last win of the season, second for Alkazemi and third for Albdulnaser.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However a post race penalty for Abdulnsaer meant that he was demoted, and Mazza was promoted to third.</p>\n\n<p>So, George King was the 2021/22 Gulf Radical Cup Champion, with Ian Loggie Vice Champion and Alex Bukh taking third.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/592/original/CK_02128.jpeg?1647877567 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/592/std/CK_02128.jpeg?1647877567\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/592/std/CK_02128.jpeg?1647877567\"></p>\n\n<p>Later that night, at the awards ceremony King collected his well deserved Gulf Radical Cup. Alex Bukh was also awarded Rookie of the year, being the highest scoring rookie. Julien Monie was awarded the Gentlemen of the Season award, and Team Pakistan took the Across the Line award for the most racing laps completed of any entry.</p>\n\n<p>A great season overall, with an average of 16 cars on the grid at every race, some of the best racing and a very worthy champion in George King. We wish him good luck in his further racing endeavours where he will surely continue to so the rest of the drivers the way!</p>\n\n<p>Until next season, many thanks for the support of all the racers, team and fans of the Gulf Radical Cup!</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.gulfradicalcup.com/championship-points\">Final Championship Standings</a>"

This also proved as a very valuable 3.5 hours of Radical only test time for a couple of drivers that will be making their racing debut next week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Johnny Khazzoum who took part in the test commented:</strong></p>\n\n<p>“It was a wonderful experience to be a part of the Gulf Radical Cup Pre Season Test, it was highly productive having the track exclusive for Radicals and very well organized by GulfSport Racing. The 3 and a half hours were more than enough to test and help us get ready for the race. It's electrifying to know that there will be more cars on the gridline on the first race.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>My personal experience with three events last season was absolutely phenomenal; hence I decided to participate in the full Championship 2020-2021! Gearing up with full-throttle practice sessions and a month-long preparation, I am truly thrilled and excited for the upcoming races. I am looking forward to a challenging and competitive race with the gentlemen. I would like to wish everyone all the best and a safe racing season this year.”</p>\n\n<p>Including the Dragon Wednesday test on the 11th prior to the event, there is a total of 8.5 hours of track time available to drivers for the first event!</p>\n\n<p>Rounds 1 and 2 see both races and qualifying take place on the Friday (13th), so it will not only be important to be quick but maybe the fittest drivers might emerge first at the finish line!</p>\n\n<p>Click the button below for the event timetable, provisional entry list in the gallery.

All eyes were on George King, who had won every single race this season so far. But with some of the new drivers showing great pace in testing, was that clean sheet about to be broken?</p>\n\n<p>Not yet, as it was indeed King who took the pole from his team mate Ian Loggie by 0.321 of a second. In third was Alex Bukhantsov with Usmaan Mughal in 4th. Newcomers to this event,&nbsp; Gregg Gorski and Jacopo Mazza took 5th and 6th respectively.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/555/original/CCK_1527.jpeg?1643712164 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/555/std/CCK_1527.jpeg?1643712164\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/555/std/CCK_1527.jpeg?1643712164\"></p>\n\n<p>Going into Race 1, George King got his usual perfect start and edged into the lead, closely followed by Ian Loggie in second. Feyzulin and Khazzoum got a little too close, on the opening lap making contact. Gorski who had made a poor start was now working his way through the field, and as the race drew to a close he was chasing third place Feyzulin , about 0.9 of a second per lap faster. But, as the old saying goes; “I just needed one more lap”, it wasn’t quite enough for Gorski to make the pass. Loggie had retired the car leaving Mughal safe with his first podium for second place and Feyzulin holding onto third.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/549/original/CCK_1854.jpeg?1643712161 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/549/std/CCK_1854.jpeg?1643712161\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/549/std/CCK_1854.jpeg?1643712161\"></p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0lUeSWDRiw\">Watch Race 2</a></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sprint Race 2, it was again King who took the lead into the first turn, but behind him they were four wide. Mazza, Loggie, Bukhantsov and Kazemi. However, with great respectful racing they jostled and filtered through with Loggie wining the 4 way battle, Mazza and Kazemi close behind.</p>\n\n<p>As the field came around to the main pits (all races were starting from the Support Pits) Ray-Yu Wang put his nose up the inside of Khazzoum, but they made contact and spun out at high speed. With cars going everywhere it split the pack. Huskinson came off best from the incident and lead the pack in 10th place.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/550/original/CCK_2394.jpeg?1643712161 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/550/std/CCK_2394.jpeg?1643712161\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/550/std/CCK_2394.jpeg?1643712161\"></p>\n\n<p>On the second lap Mazza ran wide in to turn 5 allowing Kazemi to slip through to 3rd.</p>\n\n<p>The race settled a bit with King pulling away, leaving Loggie safe for second, but the fight was on for third. Kazemi now lead a train of three cars, he was being chased by Bukhantsov, Feyzulin and Mazza. Further down the field Moorad was making his way forward after dropping to the back while avoiding the first lap incident.</p>\n\n<p>As the race drew to a close it looked safe for King to take the win with Loggie in second, but third was still all to play for. Kazemi for now was holding onto his second podium of the weekend, and now with Bukhantsov having passed Mazza they were starting to trip over each other, just allowing Kazemi to pull a small gap.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/551/original/CCK_2476.jpeg?1643712161 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/551/std/CCK_2476.jpeg?1643712161\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/551/std/CCK_2476.jpeg?1643712161\"></p>\n\n<p>And that is how it ended, King taking his 8th race win, Loggie second with Kazemi holding on to a well deserved third.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/553/original/CCK_2883.jpeg?1643712163 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/553/std/CCK_2883.jpeg?1643712163\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/553/std/CCK_2883.jpeg?1643712163\"></p>\n\n<p>So, into Saturday and the Enduro qualifying and race - easy right! Well, maybe not!</p>\n\n<p>Qualifying went off without incident, again King taking Pole from Loggie and Bukhantsov in third. Then the drivers waited some 8 hours for other championships to compete their races. One of which was the Hankook 6 hour (incidentally with Gregg Gorski taking part in his Lamborghini), anyway, just in the last few moments of that race a huge crash at Turn 1 caused considerable damage to the armco (drivers all ok), but this put another hour delay on the start of the Enduro Race.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Then the call came through that the delay would be longer with no time estimate given. This left the GRC organisers with some tough choices, cancel the race, possibly look to postpone to the following day, or, to race, on the South Circuit. Bizarrely this exact same scenario had occurred a few years ago when a Lambourgini Trofeo car went through a barrier at the end of the back straight.</p>\n\n<p>The decision was taken to race, and the south circuit was prepared. Drivers were given a 15 minute test session before normal race routine could start.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/552/original/CCK_2494.jpeg?1643712163 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/552/std/CCK_2494.jpeg?1643712163\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/552/std/CCK_2494.jpeg?1643712163\"></p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5hYWEV7qs\">Watch Race 3</a></h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Again, King got a great start but Mughal was also storming into turn 1, trying to run the outside of King, but not quite having enough he settled into 2nd place, with Bukhantsov third. But as the drivers came to the end of their third lap the safety car was deployed. Ciosek had run wide in the ‘link’ corner and could not get the car into reverse. It took a couple of laps to get him moved and we were racing again. King approached the start line very slowly and Mughal went for it as the lights turned green. Side by side as they went over the line it was King that held the inside into turn one, and once again into the lead. But maybe this was Team Pakistans chance, they had no pit penalty, where as King had 15 seconds from his previous race win. King was first to pit, leading Mughal in the lead, then it was Mughal in the following lap.</p>\n\n<p>But as they exited the pits King remained in the lead - how? Well the answers would come shortly.</p>\n\n<p>As all the other drivers exited the pits a great battle was developing for 2nd, 3rd and 4th, between Khazzoum, Feyzulin and the chasing Gorski.</p>\n\n<p>All of a sudden a 20 second penalty was posted on the timing screens for King, for incorrect pit stop time, this must have been how he had retained the lead, but now with the penalty he would have to work hard to build up a gap to the chasing group to keep that lead. However, with the battle for 2nd slowing the pace, it looked like King would retain the lead and claim his 9th win, fantastic!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/556/original/CCK_1840.jpeg?1643712164 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/556/std/CCK_1840.jpeg?1643712164\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/556/std/CCK_1840.jpeg?1643712164\"></p>\n\n<p>The battle for 2nd had now grown in size with Bukhanstov joining the party. As the last lap came about it was Gorski lining up a move to take 3rd place from Feyzulin. The plan, to try and get a run on him over the line, but in doing so Bukanstiov saw the gap and went for it, running Gorski wide and ultimately spinning off! Great racing from all, no hard feelings and all smiles at the end.</p>\n\n<p>Another demonstration of consistent, fast driving from King, but glimmers of hope from the chasing pack that the they are getting closer! But i’m sure King would disagree!</p>\n\n<p>Just a 10 day gap now, and the Gulf Radical Cup is back in action at the Dubai Autodrome, with qualifying kicking off on the 4th of Feb.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/557/original/CCK_2620.jpeg?1643713107 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/557/std/CCK_2620.jpeg?1643713107\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/557/std/CCK_2620.jpeg?1643713107\"></p>"

A host of special awards also recognised other significant performances and achievements by teams and individuals who have excelled in their own field, or made special contributions to the paddock over the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Representatives of Radical’s core partners were also in attendance – with Motor Sport Director Europe Manfred Sandbichler representing Hankook Tyres, Axel Hildebrand and Jasmine Kirkby from the Anglo American Oil Company and Nick Turner, Business Development Manager for lubricants partner Motul.</p>\n\n<p>Sandbichler was on-hand to present the awards for the European Masters competitors. While <strong>Mark Crader</strong> and <strong>Alex Mortimer </strong>won the Supersports class, Crader also took the overall champions’ award alongside co-driver <strong>Stuart Moseley</strong>, who collected the trophy in his co-driver’s absence.</p>\n\n<p>Hildebrand had the honour of handing over the awards for Radical’s premier domestic championship – the SR3-based Challenge. <strong>Peter Tyler</strong> and <strong>Tom Gladdis</strong> received their award for topping the Team Challenge class – for two driver entries – while <strong>Dominik Jackson</strong> picked up his trophy for winning the Solo Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The foundation SR1 Cup enjoyed a strong year, with growing grids and close competition. Radical’s Business Development Manager, Nick Turner presented overall champion <strong>James Pinkerton</strong> with his award, as well as <strong>Will Hunt</strong> with the Rookie Cup and <strong>David Tagg</strong> with the Fangio Trophy – for drivers aged over 45.</p>\n\n<p>One of the highlights of the night was the raft of special awards handed out across the championships. Scrutineers <strong>Phil and Rob Mason</strong> took the Drivers’ Award, as voted for by the panel of professional drivers, in recognition of their indispensable services to Radical racing for over a decade.</p>\n\n<p>SR3 racer <strong>Brian Murphy</strong>’s Orwin Racing team were presented with the Privateers’ Award for outstanding podium performance for a small team.</p>\n\n<p>Together with his Challenge trophy, <strong>Dominik Jackson</strong> was also presented with the Clerk’s Award – for upholding exceptional sportsmanship across the season.</p>\n\n<p>Scorpio Motorsport was presented with the Technical Award for expanding its operations to run multiple cars across both UK championships, taking SR1 Cup driver <strong>Will Hunt</strong> to this year’s Rookie title as well as competing in Radical Challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hunt’s SR1 Rookie Class rival <strong>Chris Short</strong> was presented with the 2018 Outstanding Achievement Award for his efforts on-track, which included some battling drives to outright podium finishes.</p>\n\n<p>Sunoco’s popular Fastest Lap Awards were shared by <strong>Stuart Moseley</strong> (European Masters) and <strong>Dominik Jackson</strong> (Challenge), who completed a memorable hat-trick of silverware on the night.</p>\n\n<p>The final award of the evening inducted a new driver into the Radical Hall of Fame. Created to recognise some of the most competitive, dedicated and longstanding Radical competitors, Radical Directors Andreas Zielke and Jan Osterloh proudly awarded <strong>Steve Burgess</strong> with the honour. Burgess began racing a Radical over a decade ago in the Clubmans Cup, winning the championship in 2014 before going on to lift the Radical Challenge title in 2016 and rank runner-up in both 2017 and 2018. Burgess is truly a worthy candidate for recognition.</p>\n\n<p>Summarising the Night of Champions, Radical Championship Coordinator Carly Latcham said: “The Night of Champions is always a brilliant event, gathering all of Radical’s drivers, teams, sponsors, staff and volunteers who all help make our race weekends so special. There’s always a great family atmosphere, which is something that’s so special to the company.</p>\n\n<p>“Celebrating our champions on stage is great, and the series of special awards act to pick out some of the outstanding performers from within our racing community. 2018 was a very strong season, but that doesn’t stop us from aiming higher for 2019 while continuing to offer the type of cost-effective, close and friendly racing that Radical has become famous for.”</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<u><strong>Radical Championship Awards 2018 - Who won what?</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><u><strong>SR1 Cup</strong></u><br>\n<strong>Fangio Trophy:</strong><br>\nSecond: Paul Clark<br>\nFirst: David Tagg<br>\n<strong>Rookie Cup:</strong> Will Hunt<br>\n<strong>Overall:</strong><br>\nThird: Will Hunt<br>\nSecond: Ryan Harper-Ellam<br>\nFirst: James Pinkerton</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Radical Challenge</strong></u><br>\n<strong>Team Challenge</strong><br>\nThird: Adrian &amp; Joe Watt<br>\nSecond: John Caudwell &amp; Stuart Moseley<br>\nFirst: Peter Tyler &amp; Tom Gladdis<br>\n<strong>Solo Challenge</strong><br>\nThird: Jerôme de Sadeleer<br>\nSecond: Steve Burgess<br>\nFirst: Dominik Jackson</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>European Masters</strong></u><br>\n<strong>Supersports:&nbsp;</strong><br>\nFirst: Mark Crader &amp; Alex Mortimer<br>\n<strong>Masters:</strong><br>\nThird: Andrew &amp; Jeremy Ferguson<br>\nSecond: Louis Hamilton-Smith &amp; Theodor Olsen<br>\nFirst: Mark Crader &amp; Stuart Moseley</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Special Awards</strong></u><br>\nSunoco Fastest Lap: Stuart Moseley (European Masters); Dominik Jackson (Challenge)<br>\nDrivers’ Award: Phil and Rob Mason<br>\nPrivateers’ Award: Brian Murphy, Orwin Racing<br>\nScrutineer's Award: Avidity Motorsport<br>\nClerk’s Award: Dominik Jackson<br>\nTechnical Award: Scorpio Motorsport<br>\nOutstanding Achievement: Chris Short</p>\n\n<p>Radical Hall of Fame 2018: Steve Burgess&nbsp;</p>"

With double points awarded for the last three races, the Championship has been decided at the last event for the past 4 seasons. Racing on a circuit that virtually none of the drivers have laid eyes on before will be a real challenge!\n&nbsp;\nThe promoter of the GRC, GulfSport Racing has been working closely with the Qatar Motor &amp; Motorcycle Federation (QMMF) and Losail Circuit Sports Club (LCSC) to make this event happen and agreement was reached last week.\n&nbsp;\nRound 7 in Qatar will take place on the 24th, 25th, 26th March* in Losail Circuit. Drivers will have the option to take part in a 3 hour private Gulf Radical Cup test on the Thursday, followed by 30 minute free practice on the Friday morning. Friday will then see the Sprint Race qualifying session and two Sprint Races; a busy day! Saturday features a qualifying session and a 45 minute Enduro Race.\n&nbsp;\nKhalid Al Remaihi (LCSC Vice President and General Manager) commented:\n“We are pleased to have the Gulf Radical Cup racing with us at the Losail International Circuit. Hosting a round of this series in Qatar will be a new challenge for the drivers and an exciting weekend of racing for all of us. We look forward to welcoming the teams, their drivers, the media and all the staff involved in the event.”\n&nbsp;\nRadicals were last on track in Qatar in 2015 with Russian Sergey Shalunov taking a double win.\n&nbsp;\nMartin Hope (Managing Partner at GulfSport Racing LLC) said:\n&nbsp;\"It’s been a few years since the GRC has left the shores of the UAE, but I think it's time again to show the rest of the Gulf what have to offer with the Gulf Radical Cup. Interest is really high this season, especially with our new 21 race format. We look forward to going to Qatar, the track is super fast, so we expect some amazing racing and seeing who will be the 2021/22 Champion”.\n&nbsp;\nThe season officially kicks off on the 1st of November with a pre season test at the Dubai Autodrome, followed by the first rounds of the championship just a couple of weeks later.\n&nbsp;\n* Provisional Date"

He would have also earned Pole for the second Sprint race if it was not for having his second quick time removed for a track limit penalty. That meant that season newcomer Timo Recker would also take his first career pole - two happy drivers indeed!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/964/original/CKD_8016.jpeg?1673441081 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/964/std/CKD_8016.jpeg?1673441081\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/964/std/CKD_8016.jpeg?1673441081\"></p>\n\n<p>Alkazemi got a great start and got to T1 first and took the lead running side by side with Recker on the run to T2. Alex Bukhanstov, who had virtually no testing time due to an accident, and then subsequent engine change was chasing hard behind Amir Feyzulin in 4th. As the cars came into turn 6 Bukhantsov made light contact with the rear of Feyzulin&nbsp;spinning him around. Alex would later get a 20 second penalty for causing a collision, this would prove crucial in the end results.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/963/original/CKD_8336.jpeg?1673441080 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/963/std/CKD_8336.jpeg?1673441080\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/963/std/CKD_8336.jpeg?1673441080\"></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile Alkazemi had started to gain a small lead of about three seconds over Mazza in second, but Alex Bukh was catching fast, however with the 20 second penalty it was looking unlikely that he would be able to catch the leader and extend that kind of lead. Alkazemi was pushing hard to try and keep that lead from a now charging Bukhantsov. Alkazemi was unaware of the penalty that Bukh had picked up and while pushing hard got himself two consecutive track limit penalties, totalling 20 seconds. So with Bukh and Alkazemi on penalties the win was gifted to Mazza, who kept it clean for the whole race!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/962/original/CKD_8420.jpeg?1673441080 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/962/std/CKD_8420.jpeg?1673441080\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/962/std/CKD_8420.jpeg?1673441080\"></p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/961/original/CKD_8546.jpeg?1673441079 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/961/std/CKD_8546.jpeg?1673441079\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/961/std/CKD_8546.jpeg?1673441079\"></p>\n\n<p>Race two was looking shaky given the rain that ensued, so the organisers made a quick decision not to waste everyone’s time that day, and re-scheduled Sprint Race 2 for the following morning, before the Enduro Qualifying session. The weather was looking bright and clear for the next day.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/960/original/VEP_6272.jpeg?1673441079 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/960/std/VEP_6272.jpeg?1673441079\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/960/std/VEP_6272.jpeg?1673441079\"></p>\n\n<p>As the drivers woke up for Race Day 2, it was still cloudy, however this didn’t stop play and it was straight out into Sprint Race 2. This time it was Recker on pole, Feyzulin was meant to be lining up alongside, but the space was left empty due to his last moment withdrawal.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/958/original/VEP_6227_%281%29.jpeg?1673441078 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/958/std/VEP_6227_%281%29.jpeg?1673441078\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/958/std/VEP_6227_%281%29.jpeg?1673441078\"></p>\n\n<p>At the start Recker did not make a clean start and was not able to maximise his pole advantage, but Alex Bukh did from&nbsp;P6, and was soon into the lead coming into turn two. Mazza was in to second and hanging onto the back of Bukh, but just didn’t have the pace to get close enough to make a pass. Recker was in third, but was later handed a 10 second penalty that would drop him to 5th, promoting John Corbett to the last step of the podium.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/956/original/WhatsApp_2BImage_2B2023-01-10_2Bat_2B15.56.12.jpeg?1673441077 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/956/std/WhatsApp_2BImage_2B2023-01-10_2Bat_2B15.56.12.jpeg?1673441077\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/956/std/WhatsApp_2BImage_2B2023-01-10_2Bat_2B15.56.12.jpeg?1673441077\"></p>\n\n<p>Shortly after that was Enduro qualifying, and Alex Bukhantsov really showed his pace, putting in a pole time of 1.58.998, but only 0.081 ahead of Mazza. Sorokin had pulled off at T1, with an engine issue, but amazingly his GulfSport Racing team changed the powerplant in just 92 minutes, so he was back out for the Enduro race.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/955/original/CKD_8005.jpeg?1673441076 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/955/std/CKD_8005.jpeg?1673441076\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/955/std/CKD_8005.jpeg?1673441076\"></p>\n\n<p>At the start Bukh and Mazza were 1st and 2nd. Alkazemi was up to third but with Recker behind him. However the two leaders both had carried over pit stop penalties from the last race, so there was a real chance Alkazemi and Recker could undercut them in the pits. But disaster struck for Alkazemi, stalling away from his 45 second pitstop, and giving crucial time back to Bukh and Mazza. This also allowed Zig Fuhremiester and John Corbett to jump ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/957/original/CKD_8534.jpeg?1673441077 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/957/std/CKD_8534.jpeg?1673441077\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/957/std/CKD_8534.jpeg?1673441077\"></p>\n\n<p>In the end Mazza, held onto the lead, with Bukh second and Recker third.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Ian Loggie and Johnny Khazzoum were in action again after missing the last couple of rounds, and both looking to get back to podium form. Newcomer to the world of Radical racing was ex US Marine Keith Gatehouse, making his debut this weekend. In for the weekend was British racer, and Atlantic rower, Stephen Shanly. Shanly, who has not taken to the gird in 17 years caught back the racing bug a few months ago when testing a Radical SR3 in the UK with the Radical Motorsport Works Team. Having previously raced and won the UK National Supersports series it was expected that he would take to the Radical like a duck to water! Finally, the last new face of the weekend was Alim Geshev, who has been patiently doing months of test days in his SR3, but had shown great pace and was looking forward to his first race!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/029/original/CKD_0082.jpeg?1678092269 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/029/std/CKD_0082.jpeg?1678092269\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/029/std/CKD_0082.jpeg?1678092269\"></p>\n\n<p>With the title fight now really between Jacopo Mazza and Alex Bukhantsov, there was for sure going to be some close racing to get a hold of those valuable points. Sitting in third in the standing was Timo Recker, but with Ian Loggie, Johnny Khazzoum and Amir Feyzulin all within a few points it was also going to be a close run race between those four.</p>\n\n<p>Loggie topped the time sheets in official free practice, but with Bukh not taking to the track and Mazza to be seemingly cruising, it was still not clear who would have the minerals when it came to Sprint Race Qualifying the following morning.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/028/original/CKD_0125.jpeg?1678092268 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/028/std/CKD_0125.jpeg?1678092268\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/028/std/CKD_0125.jpeg?1678092268\"></p>\n\n<p>So as the twenty minute session started it appeared that Bukh was blisteringly fast with a 1.40.126 on lap 4. However 11 times were taken away from drivers for track limit infringements during the session, meaning that drivers had to push again for a quick lap, or in some case settle for a slower time posted. But in the end it was Bukh on pole with Loggie in second, and a great 3rd for Khazzoum, with Nicolas Francis in 4th.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/027/original/CKD_9396.jpeg?1678092268 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/027/std/CKD_9396.jpeg?1678092268\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/027/std/CKD_9396.jpeg?1678092268\"></p>\n\n<p>In Sprint Race 1, it was Loggie and Bukh that got away well to lead into turn one. But Recker make light contact with the rear of Mazza, spinning him around. Unfortunately Feyzulin was unable to miss the spinning Mazza, and they collided hard in turn 1, taking them both out of the race. Not a good start to weekend for them both. Safety car deployed!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/026/original/CKD_9506.jpeg?1678092267 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/026/std/CKD_9506.jpeg?1678092267\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/026/std/CKD_9506.jpeg?1678092267\"></p>\n\n<p>Recker was later given a 20 second penally for causing that collision.</p>\n\n<p>After a couple of laps the race got started again, and as the race progressed Bukh was able to pull a decent gap to Loggie, while Khazzoum was safe in 3rd place also posting constant times.</p>\n\n<p>Shanly kept out of trouble and took a easy 4th place, with Julien Monie in 5th, and Alim Geshev taking a great 6th in his debut race.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/025/original/CKD_0314.jpeg?1678092266 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/025/std/CKD_0314.jpeg?1678092266\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/025/std/CKD_0314.jpeg?1678092266\"></p>\n\n<p>A couple of hours later, and Sprint Race 2 was underway. It was the same front row as before, with Bukh on Pole, and Loggie in second. However Bukh was caught napping at the start and made a poor get away dropping him back. This left Loggie and Khazzoum to take charge at the front. As the cars rushed into turn 10 at 225kph, Bukh tried to take back some places, but made contact with the back of Shanly as they both turned in, spinning him around. This left Shanly stranded in the middle of the track seemingly unable to restart the car. So for the second time the safety car was brought out. However just as that happened he got the car started and raced off, but, in a bizarre moment as Shanly pulled away Feyzulin pulled off track with a technical issue. So the safety car stayed out while Feyzulin was recovered.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/024/original/CKD_9493.jpeg?1678092266 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/024/std/CKD_9493.jpeg?1678092266\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/024/std/CKD_9493.jpeg?1678092266\"></p>\n\n<p>The race got back underway with Loggie leading from Mazza. Mazza was shadowing Loggie’s every move and on lap 12, 1 lap from the end was able to get past and claim the victory. Loggie took 2nd with Khazzoum again in 3rd.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/023/original/CKD_1016.jpeg?1678092266 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/023/std/CKD_1016.jpeg?1678092266\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/023/std/CKD_1016.jpeg?1678092266\"></p>\n\n<p>The following day was Enduro day, and in Enduro qualifying Bukh again showed his form taking pole, from Mazza in 2nd and Recker in 3rd.</p>\n\n<p>The race got underway and Bukh took the lead from Mazza. Both carrying “success penalties” from the previous Enduro aT Yas, it was Recker who had to stay in touch to try and make the leap during the pits stops. The front 5 cars were within a few seconds of each other for the first half of the race, and has the pitstop window opened Bukh held his nerve and stayed out. Recker and Mazza came in together. With the extended pitstop time for Mazza, Recker slipped out ahead to take 2nd, but Mazza was on a charge and slipped back past on the out lap. The next lap Bukh came in, but with his 15 second penalty he lost the lead. Pretty soon after that a gearbox issue slipped in and he dropped down the order, but kept it going to the end of the race to pick up vital points.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/020/original/CKD_0254.jpeg?1678092263 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/020/std/CKD_0254.jpeg?1678092263\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/020/std/CKD_0254.jpeg?1678092263\"></p>\n\n<p>So that left Mazza to take the victory from Recker in 2nd, and Khazzoum again in 3rd (meaning he stepped on the podium for all three races).</p>\n\n<p>Mazza has retained his lead in the championship from Bukh, with Recker still hanging on in 3rd!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/021/original/AK__1005.jpeg?1678092264 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/021/std/AK__1005.jpeg?1678092264\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/021/std/AK__1005.jpeg?1678092264\"></p>\n\n<p>A short break, then off to Yas Marina Circuit on the 10th to 12th of March.

Safety car was deployed while the stricken SR3 XX of Recker was recovered, Mazza was able to limp back to the pits.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/044/original/CKD_2127.jpeg?1681807355 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/044/std/CKD_2127.jpeg?1681807355\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/044/std/CKD_2127.jpeg?1681807355\"></p>\n\n<p>After 4 laps of safety car the field was racing again, Bukh resumed the lead with Al Khazami in second and Alim Geshev in third. Bukh was able to pull a comfortable 10 second gap by the end of the race over the Kuwaiti driver in second, with Geshev only 2 seconds behind. This was the first podium for Russian driver Geshev. Following the race, Recker was given a grid penalty for the the Enduro race, after having being deemed responsible for the collision between him and Mazza at turn 1.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/042/original/CKD_2840.jpeg?1681807354 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/042/std/CKD_2840.jpeg?1681807354\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/042/std/CKD_2840.jpeg?1681807354\"></p>\n\n<p>The following day was Enduro race day, and started with the 15 minute qualifying session. It was a carbon copy of the previous day with Bukh on pole, with Recker in second and Mazza in third. However Recker would have to give that place back before the race even started with his penalty.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/041/original/CKD_2600.jpeg?1681807353 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/041/std/CKD_2600.jpeg?1681807353\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/041/std/CKD_2600.jpeg?1681807353\"></p>\n\n<p>As the race started it was Recker who got a great start and took the lead from Bukh, with Mazza struggling, eventually pulling out on lap 3. As the pit stops came around the cars dived in and Bukh, who had no success penalty from the last race was able to jump into the lead, with Recker coming out behind him. Recker who appeared to have the pace this race was then left to hunt Bukh down and maybe take his first race win. As the two came onto turn 5, small contact was made and they both raced off side by side down the long back straight of Yas Marina Circuit. Recker was on the inside and late on the brakes, taking the lead.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/039/original/CKD_2712.jpeg?1681807350 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/039/std/CKD_2712.jpeg?1681807350\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/039/std/CKD_2712.jpeg?1681807350\"></p>\n\n<p>Alex worked to stay in contention, but after a few laps it appeared he had a mechanical issue slowing him down, allowing Geshev to get past him and into second. As the chequered flag came out it was Recker across the line first with a 25 second lead over Geshev, and Buhk just hanging onto third! However it was not all done….</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/038/original/VEP_6264.jpeg?1681807350 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/038/std/VEP_6264.jpeg?1681807350\" width=\"375\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/038/std/VEP_6264.jpeg?1681807350\"></p>\n\n<p>Geshev was given a 10 second penalty for undercutting his mandatory pit stop time, resulting in him being pushed to 4th and off the podium - gutted. Johnny Khazzoum was promoted to third. Recker was also back in the stewards room and was awarded a 20 second penalty for the contact with Bukh while racing for the lead. However he had built up a large enough lead for him to be able to hang onto his maiden victory.</p>\n\n<p>With only a couple of days to gather the thoughts of Yas, as it was off the following weekend to Dubai for the final round of the Gulf Radical Cup.</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.gulfradicalcup.com/news/2023/4/12/round-6-race-report\">READ MORE</a>"

The WISKO Racing driver set the fastest 1500 lap of the weekend in Race 3 at Barber, and kept out of trouble to finish the weekend with two podiums and the points lead. The Puerto Rican has unfinished business after finishing runner up in 2018 (PRO 1340) and third in 2019 (PRO 1500), and he hopes 2021 could be his year.</p>\n\n<p>However, a number of other junior drivers are also looking to make their mark this year including Nick Pearson, Alex Morton, Max Fedler, Palmer Miller (Esses Racing / Radical Texas) and Noah Ping (Comprent Motor Sports), with the latter two sitting second and third respectively in class points.</p>\n\n<p>Both Miller and Ping showed they had raw pace at Barber, but had ragged weekends, and will need to reign in their youthful exuberance at Road America to ensure they don’t give up any more points to penalties. Nevertheless, their confidence will be sky high after they both scored maiden victories at Barber.</p>\n\n<p>Looking to claw their way back into contention at Road America are two seasoned competitors. Gregg Gorski (One Motorsports) and Steve Jenks (Group-A Racing) both resisted stepping up to the Platinum class and the new SR10, to focus on winning the PRO 1500 championship. Jenks finished runner up last year, while Gorksi was third, and both have what it takes to bring the title home. Currently they sit fourth and fifth, respectively, in the PRO 1500 class points.</p>"

From running the original ‘Radical Cup’ series to a twelve-year ‘David and Goliath’ pursuit of an outright win in the NASA 25 Hours of Thunderhill with Radical machinery, to helping to develop Radical club racers into professional drivers, Shafer and his ONE Motorsports outfit have been instrumental.

          "content": "<p><strong>Radical Cup North America (NA)</strong> – Where did it all start?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> – It all started for me in karting. I believe it was my mom who purchased me a three-day school at Jim Hall Kart Racing when I was 12. Kids these days are pros by 12! I got an afterschool job at Pitts Performance where I learned the trade of building and maintaining karts and engines for customers while I also raced. I graduated from cars by winning some scholarships. Elf Winfield in France, the Skip Barber Shootout, and the Team Green Academy. I’ve been fortunate to race all kinds of disciplines from sprint and endurance racing to dirt and paved ovals in many types of equipment. Stock cars, dwarf cars, Formula Atlantic, F2000, GT3, Prototypes, and of course Radicals. I worked at several driving schools eventually becoming the general manager at Derek Daly Academy. Going back to my karting roots of supporting customer cars and doing some coaching still gave me the opportunity to drive on occasion so it seemed like a natural fit for me. So here we are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA&nbsp;</strong>– And the One Motorsports Team?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> – My wife Jolene and I started the business back in 2005. We have been very fortunate, and our success has so much to do with my brother Brian who has been with us since the beginning, and Cameron and Mason who joined shortly after. &nbsp;We started by providing members who owned Radicals at Spring Mountain with an option to do some traveling to other facilities for event weekends. It started out as track days for fun and as it became more serious, like wanting to know lap times, then adding data loggers and doing some informal races.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – And that was the beginning of what we know today as the Blue Marble Radical Cup?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> – Yes, this ultimately grew into organized races which we called ‘Radical Cup’. For many years we organized the series and fielded all the cars. At one point we ran 20 cars at Laguna Seca. It was a lot of work, but we were always guaranteed to sweep the podium! Obviously, the series has come a long way from then, and while we no longer run it, we’re still aiming for podiums.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – Did ONE Motorsports compete in other series before the Blue Marble Radical Cup?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> – Nothing [before]. We have been loyal to Radical since the very beginning. I have always been a believer in why change something if all is going well. But over the years we’ve run LMP3 and IMSA Lites in parallel to our Radical program, typically for Radical drivers looking for the next step. Crowdstrike’s Gerhard Watzinger is just one of several guys we’ve helped.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – That’s very modest. You’ve had a few names come through the Radical and ONE Motorsport ranks, haven’t you?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> – Yes, I guess so, George Kurtz is another. Gerhard and George started in Radicals, and they recently drove Lewis Hamilton’s F1 car. Of course, Kurtz is a regular in SRO and Gerhard’s been doing Super Trofeo in Europe. Then there’s John Falb who went from racing Radical Cup to winning the ELMS LMP3 title and races at Le Mans every year now. Patrick Liddy is another we’ve helped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – So what about the cars, over the years, I guess you’ve seen a few changes?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> - We started running Radicals in 2005. I remember seeing the first high downforce SR3, the first fuel-injected SR3, the first paddle shift SR3, and so on. Seeing where Radical started compared to the product they currently produce - ‘wow’ - have they dialed it in! Everything from the cars to the dealer network, the parts, and the support, to the race series, is top-notch. It’s getting more attention now but it’s still one of the hidden gems in motorsports.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – Well don’t stop, what’s it like in being in the Radical Cup paddock?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> - A couple of staples do seem to be the camaraderie between teams and drivers, friendship, and everyone working together. Since taking over the running of the series, Radical Motorsport has done a great job in bringing series partners, and the promotion has grown leaps and bounds. Not to mention it’s come a long way – from club-level weekends to supporting INDYCAR.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – Final bit of flattery. Why should someone choose Radical Cup over another series?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> - Besides the car which is an excellent platform for reliable, safe, and fair racing, the series hospitality, and ample track time make the Radical Cup very economical for this level of racing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – If you could change one thing about the Radical Cup, what would you change?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> - That ONE Motorsports drivers win every race. Haha. Or maybe an endurance race or two.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – Speaking of endurance racing you have some experience…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> – You could say that. We have fielded a Radical SR3 at the 25 Hours of Thunderhill 12 times. A 1500 and 1340cc engine against Flying Lizard Porsches, LMP2 cars, you name it. We developed our own long-range fuel tank that wraps around the driver into the passenger compartment, all sorts of special lighting, heated steering wheels, and a double-stator system to increase the electrical output, which unfortunately won the race with Turn 3 and Peter Dempsey a year before we did as a team.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – That was 2019, right? And you won it in 2021?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> – Yes, we had won the ESR class on several occasions over the years, but the outright win was proving painfully elusive. In a way it was heart-wrenching to lose to Turn 3 in 2019 and then have the race called off in ’20 due to COVID just extended the pain. But beating the LMP3 and the likes of Colin Braun and Matt Bell [who co-drove alongside Naveen Rao, Jon Bennett, and George Kurtz] made up for it. Especially as I was driving alongside two young Radical Cup stars, Jordan Missig and Anthony Bullock [along with Josh Sachet]. Endurance racing is a whole different level of stress for a team and its owner, and the weather that event normally throws you–&nbsp;cold, wet, fog, a muddy race track– it's the most grueling event I’ve ever done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – So is more endurance racing in the cards for ONE Motorsports?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> - Ultimately, we would like to find ourselves in the IMSA paddock again. As I mentioned, we have had a taste of that by running support races like LMP3 and IMSA Lites. Getting into the main show still seems like a bit of a leap but the growth of the Blue Marble Radical Cup along with having the same core team for so long has prepared us well and allowed us to gain so much knowledge and experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – Is that the key to attracting drivers to your Radical Cup team? After all, based outside of Las Vegas, you probably travel further than any other team to every round.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> – We just try to do a great job for our drivers and are open to helping most in the paddock. Advertising mostly comes from word of mouth. We know our prep work is great and our on-track performance speaks for itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Cup NA</strong> – How was the 2022 season for you, and can you tell us a bit about your 2023 drivers?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Shafer</strong> - 2022 was ok. We won a number of races but none of our drivers competed in the full season, so our best championship finish was Jon Field, who was the third in the SR10 [Platinum] class. Our 2023 effort is off to a much better start with three SR10 entries of Indy Al Miller, Alain Derzie and Jon Field, in addition to Gregg Gorski coming back in his SR3 in the Pro 1500 class. All very good drivers and should give us a great chance at the drivers and team championships. I’m very excited! I guess we can use this interview as our 2023 Driver Announcement!</p>"

Starting karting in 2015, Bijoy claimed many podiums among various series over his five-year karting stint and made the move from karts to cars in 2020, where he competed in a busy season of racing in both the USF2000 Championship and the F4 U.S. Championship and achieved multiple top-five and top-ten finishes.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing to advance his career, Garg claimed his first few podiums in the USF2000 Championship in 2022 while also making the move up to the newly renamed USF Pro 2000 Championship for the last two rounds of the season. Early in 2023, Bijoy made his debut in sports cars, claiming his first pole position and a third-place finish in the opening round of the IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge at Daytona International Raceway and continued to expand his experience by adding a few Asian Le Mans Series races in the LMP3 class to his resume.</p>\n\n<p>Team Stradale, the Chicago and Miami-based Radical dealer, is returning to the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America program after a very successful 2022 Radical World Finals with driver Michai Stephens.</p>\n\n<p>“My goal is to be an NTT INDYCAR SERIES or F1 Champion,” explained Garg. “We’re seeing tough competition and incredibly talented drivers coming out of the Radical Cup series, so I think it’s the perfect opportunity to help round out my driving skills, and also get in front of some of the high-profile Team Owners in the INDYCAR SERIES.”</p>\n\n<p>“We are very excited to have Bijoy driving our SR3 in the next Blue Marble Radical Cup race at Barber,” explained Team Principal Francesco D’Avola. “Based on his experience, we are expecting great results and should make for an exciting weekend. All the teams are actively looking for young blood to bring into the series. Young, energetic drivers like Bijoy will help bring positive attention to Radical Cup.”</p>\n\n<p>Bijoy and Team Stradale hope to make some magic happen on the hills of Alabama starting Thursday with a pair of practice sessions and will continue the weekend, concluding on Saturday evening after three wheel-to-wheel races. You can follow along with Bijoy Garg and Team Stradale this weekend by searching “Team Stradale” on Instagram.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure to stay tuned to the Blue Marble Radical Cup social media pages for news, information, photos, and results from the 2023 season.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Marble Radical Cup events are open to all local and regional Radical racers with eligible cars to participate.

          "content": "<p><strong>In Round 1, </strong>Shalunov finished just three quarters of a second behind Yousaf after racing hard for 95kms in the 35C dusk conditions.</p>\n\n<p>There were significant challenges for some of the 13 drivers who got caught out by a safety car period that was called when Sean Simpson spun the # 26 car on oil as he entered the pit lane for his mandatory pit stop. The leading quartet, who had not yet pitted took full advantage of the safety car period to dive in with the east loss of time.</p>\n\n<p>In the second half of the race it was the extremely quick D5 Racing James Edmeades who worked his way through to an impressive 3rd place in the #4 car he was sharing with Jeff Curtis.</p>\n\n<p>Dream Racing’s Tarek Elgammel, who was sharing with Hamdan Al Ghaferi set the fastest lap time of the day in the #75 car with a 2:16.882 on the last lap.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Round 2 </strong>of the 2018/19 Gulf Radical Cup was challenging from both the perspective of plus 50C track surface temperatures and close competition. Six local race teams had entered 17 drivers who would be driving identical 240bhp Radical SR3s running on Hankook slicks, a very good start to the new season.</p>\n\n<p>The combination of Yas Marina Circuit instructor Yousaf and Finnish racer Hjerppe (Dream Racing) proved unbeatable again - but only just! Russian driver Shalunov had a great race strategy courtesy of his two-time Le Mans winning driver coach Tommy Erdos, which saw Shalunov take and hold the lead after his pit stop, exiting the pits just ahead of his team mate Ian Roberts.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Shalunov found himself inexplicably in neutral coming onto the back straight on the very last lap of the race, allowing Hjerppe to take the lead and win the race. Hjerppe admitted to Shalunov that without that mistake he would not have been able to get past.</p>\n\n<p>South African driver Sean Simpson had a very strong run to take a creditable 3rd place for Dream Racing with Ian Roberts (Team GulfSport) overtaking two competitors to finish 4th.</p>\n\n<p>The race was action packed as ex-motorcycle racer Edmeades (D5 Racing with AUH) got through Turn 1 ahead of the pack, but it was the experienced Elgammel who led the first lap and opened up a sizeable lead going into the pit stop to hand over to Hamdan Al Ghaferi (Dream Racing). After taking over from Edmeades, Jeff Curtis would go on to finish in 5th place ahead of Al Ghaferi and Elgammal.</p>\n\n<p>Konstantin Tatulov (B Tuning with AUH) and Amir Feyzullin (AUH) came in 8th and 9th respectively with rookie drivers Neal Clark and Fran Cush (Team GulfSport) having a very successful first event by completing both races. Fastest lap was set by Hjerppe on lap 16 at 2:17.613</p>\n\n<p>The Gulf Radical Cup is organised and promoted by GulfSport Racing who have been providing a full customer sales and support role for teams and drivers in the region since 2004. Rounds 3 &amp; 4 will take place at the Dubai Autodrome on 16th November.</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ac345b485ede15e39a5fb46/t/5bd357b08165f588a38cea27/1540577205224/GULF+RADICAL+RACE+1+PROVISIONAL+RESULTS.pdf\">RESULTS</a>"

          "content": "<p>Radical Sportscars’ newly appointed dealer Radical Texas– powered by Esses Racing– opened its account in the best way possible. The Austin based dealer clinched all three victories in the MASTERS Class thanks to Alex Papadopulos and Judd Miller. All three races were broadcast live on FANRACING.LIVE with support from Blue Marble and Smokebuddy.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;Lap times deleted for exceeding track limits defined qualifying, as it so often does at ‘America’s home of Formula 1’. And while Alex Papadopulos was the favorite after setting a 2:08.862 in practice, it was MASTERS class points leader Terry Olson (Team FURY) who claimed pole position with a 2:08.654 late in the session. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>\nStarting alongside Olson in Race 1 was former American Le Mans Series Champion Jon Field (WISKO Racing), while John Hansen immediately impressed upon his return to the series, securing 3rd on the grid for Radical Northwest/Cameron Racing.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The other standout in Qualifying was local young-gun Palmer Miller (Radical Texas / Esses Racing). The rookie driver clinched the PRO 1500 class pole over 2018 class champion Indy Al Miller (Blue Marble / ONE Motorsports), Mel Johnson (ONE Motorsports), Gerhard Watzinger (Crowdstrike Racing), and Nate Smith (Speed du Nord), who returned to the series after missing the Barber and Laguna Seca rounds.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;However, Race 1 quickly unraveled for Palmer Miller, who found himself pointing the wrong direction in Turn 1. It was later revealed that he got a helping hand from Johnson, who was lucky to escape a penalty. Remaining composed young Miller climbed from the rear of the field to finish 5th in class. Johnson went on to battle Indy Al Miller for the lead of the PRO 1500 class. In an impressive display of driving the pair left each other just enough room as they traded positions lap after lap, before Johnson spun to avoid making contact during the tightest section of the track. This left Al Miller to take the PRO 1500 class win, from Gerhard Watzinger, and Radical New York’s Steve Jenks (Group-A Racing). Gregg Gorski (Smokebuddy / ONE Motorsports) was fourth.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;Jon Field took over the outright lead from Terry Olson, before Alex Papadopulos relegated Olson to third. It wasn’t long before Papadopulos, who has spent much of the year racing in Michelin Pilot Challenge, advanced past Field and drove off into the distance to clinch a convincing win. Fellow Radical Texas / Esses Racing teammate and the reigning class champion Judd Miller came alive mid-race and moved up to second place, while Jon Field crossed the line in third place ahead of Terry Olson. However Field’s SR8 was found to be light during the post-race inspection, which elevated Olson to third place, and dealt a blow to Field’s championship hopes.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;John Hansen was classified in 4th , while rookie Willie Putrajaya impressed with a lap to put him 5th on the grid for Race 2. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A fastest lap of 2:07.618 secured Papadopulos the outright pole for Race 2, however a gremlin in his older SR8 RX meant he was late to the grid, and Miller assumed his place. Through Turn 1 for the first time Olson did his best to get around Miller, but the Texan prevailed.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;Further back in the pack Indy Al Miller, who started 9th on the grid tried to make the most of Turn 1, but misjudged the moment and collected an innocent John Hansen. Both retired, with Miller receiving penalties for causing the wreck. By the time the full course caution came out, Papadopulos had amazingly worked his way up to 3rd. Following the restart John Field retired, as did Papadopulos when his gremlin returned.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;At times Olson looked as though he might press Miller for the win, but perhaps thinking of the championship, he settled for a solid 2nd place. Willie Putrajaya continued his impressive debut weekend with a podium finish, while Radical Texas teammate Conrad Park finished fourth.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;Mel Johnson started from the 1500 class pole thanks to a 2:11.169 lap, and also took the win after fending off Palmer Miller, who made up for Race 1 with a 2nd place finish. Gerhard Watzinger claimed the final step of the podium, holding off Alain Derize (ONE Motorsports) and Gregg Gorski. Meanwhile Tad Cusack (Team FURY) and Steve Jenks duked it out all race, with Jenks pipping Cusack for 6th place on the final lap. Finishing 7th Nate Smith got the better of Jim Booth (McDonald’s / WISKO Racing).</p>\n\n<p>Race 3 saw Judd Miller again start from the pole, but this time it was thanks to setting the fastest lap of Race 2, a 2:08.628. Sharing the front row Terry Olson again tried his best, but Judd Miller held on to the lead through the opening corners, while Papadopulos worked his way up to third. Jon Field rocketed up the order from 15th to be 8th before the safety car was deployed for Richard Durocher (Team FURY), who had made heavy contact with the wall just after receiving the green flag. After being unintentionally hit by Indy Al Miller, Durocher’s SR3 abruptly turned right, and while all safety structures of his car were intact, Durocher was visibly shaken. As a result and ‘in abundance of caution’ the track’s chief medical officer had him carefully removed from the car and transported to a local hospital. Much to the relief of his fellow competitors Durocher, while sore, was without injury and quickly discharged. The process momentarily brought out the red flag.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;Following the restart Papadopulos's luck ran out again, while Jon Field continued his charge, eventually passing Olson, who didn’t seem content giving up points to his rival. However, while Olson made a number of attempts he never put himself or his championship in jeopardy and settled for 3rd, behind Field and Judd Miller, who scored his second win of the weekend.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;Finishing 4th was John Hansen who, after purposefully hanging back at the start to ensure he got through the opening lap, set the fastest lap of the race, a 2:09.184, while working his way up through the field in what was clearly ‘drive of the day’. Putrajaya finished his weekend with 5th in the MASTERS class.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nWhile Mel Johnson had been on the PRO 1500 class pole, it was Gregg Gorski who had got the initial jump before the stoppage. However Johnson reclaimed the lead upon the restart and his second win of the weekend, while Gorski held onto 2nd after sustaining plenty of pressure from 3rd placed Steve Jenks. Palmer Miller wrapped up an impressive weekend with 4th, while Jim Booth kept Nate Smith at bay to claim 5th. Nick Pearson (Team FURY) had an epic battle with Gerhard Watzinger, getting the better of the series stalwart for 12th in class.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;Indy Al Miller received a post-race drive through penalty for incident responsibility, as well as an additional 15 point penalty as it was the second crash involving his #500 machine during the weekend. A further reprimand means Miller, who leads the PRO 1500 championship after scoring seven podiums including five wins this season, will also receive a 10-grid spot penalty for the opening race at Road Atlanta.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;Mel Johnson’s two wins have propelled him into the class championship battle, and he now sits third in the PRO 1500 standings (471) behind Gorski (477) and Miller (485). Terry Olson (490) has further increased his advantage in the MASTERS class championship over Jon Field (458) and Judd Miller (453). Chris Kemp (270, Team Stradale) sits on top of the PRO 1340 table.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The season finale at Road Atlanta takes place November 19-22. All three races will be live-streamed via SVRA.

          "content": "<p>Round 3 got off to a cracking start with the Finish Champion taking an immediate lead in the number 17 Radical SR3 followed closely by Russian driver Sergey Shalunov in the number 33 car. But on that opening lap it was British driver Ian Roberts who managed to slip by to take second place which he was to hold for the first 4 laps.</p>\n\n<p>On lap 5 Shalunov managed to regain 2nd place from Roberts, who then came under pressure from another Russian driver, Konstantin Gugkaev in the number 9 car who got by Roberts on lap 9 to move up to 3rd place.</p>\n\n<p>The Gulf Radical Cup features 45-minute races with a mandatory pit stop. To make things interesting, previous success attracts a pit stop time penalty, so Hjerppe had an extra 15 seconds and Shalunov had an extra 10 seconds based on them coming 1st and second respectively in Round 2.</p>\n\n<p>This offered Gugkaev an advantage which he used to the full to take the lead after the pitstops which he never relinquished to take his first victory in the championship. But all eyes were on Hjerppe’s driving partner Seppo Mantyla who emerged from the pitstops just a couple of seconds ahead of Shalunov who set about getting past him over the course of the second half of the race.</p>\n\n<p>But try as he might, with the gap reducing to just 0.3 of a second, Shalunov was unable to get by and decided to stay safely in 3rd place to the finish even though he set the fastest lap of the race in the process. Roberts was only 1.5 seconds adrift at the finish, a very creditable drive from this newcomer and was followed home by the experienced British duo of James Edmeades and Jeff Curtis, and Russian driver Amir Feyzulin. The Australian driver Ben Freer suffered an unfortunate puncture on lap 2 which put pay to his chances of points.</p>\n\n<p>Round 4 kicked off from a rolling start with poleman Gugkaev taking the lead followed by D5’s Edmeades, Shalunov and Mantyla in close pursuit. But by the end of lap 1, Shalunov had got past Edmeades.</p>\n\n<p>As the drivers started to burn off their heavy fuel load and settle into a fast pace it was noticeable that on lap 4 the first four cars were lapping within .13 of a second - remarkably consistent and close racing!</p>\n\n<p>But on lap 6, the hard charging Shalunov spun which cost him time and put him at the back of the pack with a lot of work to do to catch back up. Just a couple of fast laps later he was already past compatriot Feyzulin.</p>\n\n<p>After 15 minutes the pit lane was opened for the mandatory pit stop window of 10 minutes when drivers must stop their car for 45 seconds. The top 3 from the previous race have to also observe an additional pit stop penalty which can have quite a dramatic impact on the race order.</p>\n\n<p>First to pit was Gugkaev, Mantyla and Ian Roberts followed the next lap by Ben Freer and Shalunov. Edmeades brought the #4 car in just moments before the pit lane closed but was reported for speeding in the pit lane. As the race resumed with all the pit stops completed, it was Jeff Curtis in the #4 who was in the lead, followed by Gugkaev some 8.5 seconds behind and Hjerppe in the #17 just 1.2 seconds adrift.</p>\n\n<p>Within 3 laps Hjerppe had got past Gugkaev and would go on to overtake Curtis to take the lead. But at the rear of the pack Shalunov, who had been driving rapidly, just posting a purple first sector to regain his position suffered a technical issue which stopped the car in a difficult spot and which brought out the safety car. The order did not change as the race finished under the safety car giving victory to the team of Hjerppe and Mantyla, with Edmeades and Curtis in second and Gugkaev in third.</p>\n\n<p>Rounds 5 and 6 of the Gulf Radical Cup will be held on the 7th &amp; 8th December at the Dubai Autodrome.</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/gulf-radical-cup\">GULF RADICAL CUP</a>"

Ahead of the season, Bushy Park Barbados will this month (January 18/19) host an Engineering &amp; Driver Development Workshop."

          "content": "<p>In the first two seasons, there have been eight different winners in 24 races, with 2018 Champion Stuart Maloney of Barbados the most successful over the two years, claiming seven victories and a further six podium finishes, one pole position and four fastest laps. Despite failing to win a race in his debut season, 21-year-old Jamaican William Myers beat the Reigning Champion to the 2019 crown by seven points after an impressively consistent performance netted him nine podium finishes.</p>\n\n<p>The 2020 Radical Caribbean Cup will open in Barbados on March 15 at Bushy Park Motorsport Inc’s (BPMSI) first fixture of the new decade, returning for the annual BPMSI International Race Meet on August 29/30. A first visit to the Dover Raceway, hosted by the Jamaica Race Drivers Club (JRDC), is provisionally scheduled for Easter Monday (April 13), while rounds three and four will be staged by the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Automobile Sports Association (TTASA) at the Frankie Boodram International Raceway on June 28 and July 19. The Guyana Motor Racing &amp; Sports Club (GMR&amp;SC) will organise the traditional year-end finale at South Dakota over the weekend of November 7/8.</p>\n\n<p>Championship Manager Kurt Seabra is looking forward to the new season: “We have always aimed to stage races in all four countries, to reflect our competitor base – drivers from Jamaica, Barbados and T&amp;T finished in the top three positions overall last year after the final round in Guyana. I am delighted that we are returning to the Frankie Boodram International Raceway at Wallerfield, with two rounds on our expanded calendar, and I am hopeful that the discussions we have been having with the JRDC over the past couple of weeks will result in the SR3 Cup’s first-ever visit to Dover Raceway being confirmed very soon.”</p>\n\n<p>The Engineering &amp; Driver Development Workshop at Bushy Park next weekend (January 18/19) is aimed at both existing and potential participants and their pit crews. Organised by Radical Caribbean, the Workshop will be conducted by experienced race engineers and driver coaches from UK-based Kokoro Performance, led by its head of driver development Kieren Clark, who worked closely with Zane Maloney throughout his successful British F4 campaign in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Seabra adds: “The main goal of the Workshop is to give teams a better understanding of how to engineer the Radical SR3 to suit the driver's feedback and track conditions, thereby making them more self-sufficient and ultimately create an even more competitive series. There will be classroom sessions and practical work in the pit garages, along with the chance to put what is being learned into practice on the circuit.”</p>\n\n<p>Running to the same rules that have applied in Barbados since the launch of the former Suzuki Challenge Series in 2015, the Radical Caribbean Cup is a one-make series for the Suzuki-powered Radical SR3 and does not cater for the Radicals of different specifications that are now racing in the region in the hands of drivers such as Kyle Gregg and David Summerbell Jnr; all cars will be scrutineered before each qualifying round to ensure compliance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical Caribbean Cup 2020</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Engineering &amp; Driver Workshop – January 18/19, Bushy Park Barbados (Radical Caribbean)</li>\n\t<li>Round 1 – March 15, Bushy Park Barbados (BPMSI)</li>\n\t<li>Round 2 – April 13, Dover Raceway, Jamaica (JRDC) – to be confirmed</li>\n\t<li>Round 3 – June 28, Frankie Boodram International Raceway, Wallerfield, Trinidad (TTASA)</li>\n\t<li>Round 4 – July 19, Frankie Boodram International Raceway, Wallerfield, Trinidad (TTASA)</li>\n\t<li>Round 5 – August 29/30, Bushy Park Barbados (BPMSI) Round 6 - November 7/8, South Dakota, Guyana (GMR&amp;SC)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/radical-caribbean-cup\">CARIBBEAN CUP</a>"

          "content": "<p>Walker, 23 from London, will line up on the grid at the wheel of an SR1 entered by the Matthew Bentley Racing team. Walker only began racing an Elise in the Lotus Cup UK last year, and soon switched to Radicals with a one-off outing in the SR1 Cup season finale at Brands Hatch. He impressed with his pace and ease of adaption to the 182bhp SR1. After qualifying fifth overall in his first timed session, he went on to take a best finish of fourth place.</p>\n\n<p>Mackenzie comes from a prodigious racing family, with the legacy of competition stretching back to his grandfather, Ian Walker, whose eponymous racing organisation was considered as the ‘B team’ to the Lotus factory under the reign of marque founder Colin Chapman. Ian Walker would run several iterations of Lotus sports cars for drivers like Graham Hill, Jim Clark and Peter Arundell, and once even sold Chapman his house.</p>\n\n<p>Mackenzie’s father, Sean Walker, competed in single-seaters, most notably British Formula 3, before graduating into the British Touring Car Championship, and later, historic classes.&nbsp;Being a third-generation racer, Mackenzie Walker is excited to get underway and has identified a fresh opportunity to make his mark in the sport.</p>\n\n<p>“I’m really quite proud to be racing with Radical full-time this year, and to continue the family history of competing in this sport,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“I did a bit of karting when I was younger, but decided to pursue rugby instead, but I broke my shoulder three times and opted to try something else. Ian Flux [long-time Radical instructor] is a good family friend and suggested I had a test day with him, so I did and I just loved it and I’ve been pursing the sport since then.</p>\n\n<p>“I enjoyed the Lotus, but the Radical SR1 really appealed to me and my end goal is to compete at the Le Mans 24 Hours because it’s pretty much the only big race left that nobody in my family has competed in yet. It’s sort of this glaring box that needs ticking.</p>\n\n<p>“I learned a lot from my first SR1 race last year. It’s similar in layout to the Lotus, but the SR1 is much lighter, has more power-to-weight and also the downforce to learn about. In the wet it felt familiar to the Lotus, but in the dry the speed and grip is immense.</p>\n\n<p>“The lads at Matthew Bentley Racing looked after my Lotus last year and I trust them, so I’m very happy to stay with them for the SR1. I’m new to it, and they’re new to it, but we’re confident we can get our heads around the car quickly and be competitive. I want to be fighting for podiums this year, and then we’ll see where we can get to in the championship.”</p>\n\n<p>The opening round of the Radical SR1 Cup takes place at Oulton Park on Saturday, April 20, with two races in support of the prestigious British GT and Formula 3 championships.</p>"

          "content": "<p>One hundred points may sound a lot, but with 80 points up for grabs in each endurance race, there’s still everything to play for at Oulton Park. With qualifying, two 50-minute endurance battles plus a 20-minute sprint race to squeeze into one day, clean and clear drives will be key to a healthy points haul at the Cheshire track.</p>\n\n<p>De Sadeleer will be aiming to do just that with 360 Racing after a disappointing home round in Belgium, where he was forced to record his first non-finish since last August. Yet the former SR1 Cup champion refused to be kept away from the podium, scoring second in the sprint race. Having earned top-three status at Oulton last year, de Sadeleer will be gunning for glory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jac Constable encountered the trickiest weekend of his maiden Challenge season at the Spa Festival, recording his first DNF. But the Hart GT driver bounced back with a stand-out drive from the back of the grid to finish second in race three, ensuring a 32 point lead over John MacLeod in the standings. RAW Motorsport’s MacLeod has become an increasing threat this term, taking a brace of third places in the Spa endurance races to seal four podiums from the last six encounters.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Richards returns to 360 Racing having missed the last two rounds due to work commitments, and he could throw a spanner in the works for the rest of the year. A winning contender at Donington Park back in April, he’ll be looking to return to the rostrum and make up for lost points.</p>\n\n<p>He comments: “It’s always exciting to get out there racing, it’s just a shame I couldn’t be at the last two rounds. It will be difficult to challenge for the overall title from here, but I look forward to stealing some points off Dom and Jerome – they can’t have them all! I love Oulton Park, it’s a proper old-school circuit that favours the brave and punishes mistakes…let’s hope it doesn’t rain! I’m hoping that this will be the weekend where I get that elusive win, but any podium spot is a privilege given the calibre of drivers on the grid.”</p>\n\n<p>The midfield fight is tighter than ever this year with a strong gaggle of drivers honing in on a place in the top three. Count Brian Caudwell, Elliot Goodman, Spencer Bourne, John Caudwell, Jason Rishover, Brian Murphy and Rod Goodman among them, while newcomer Jon MacRae proved his rookie potential with third in the sprint race in Belgium.</p>\n\n<p>Oli Marateotto is back in the Solo class, after competing as a Team entry with father, Marcello, last time out. Guillaume Gruchet also returns to the Challenge fold as the Frenchman takes on his second Radical outing following his Snetterton debut with Newbridge Motorsport.</p>\n\n<p>In the Team class battle, Gulf Radical Cup drivers Anton Zakharov and Amir Feyzullin - both from Russia - pair up for the second time following their inaugural outing at Spa. The reignited Team class fight has also attracted Toyo Tires Porsche Championship drivers, Nick Hull and Richard Avery, as a privateer entry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Currently third in the Supersport Boxster class, Hull explains how he and fellow Porsche front-runner Avery are searching for a new adventure, backed by York-based Thermotech Building Maintenance (TBM) Limited. “Having raced in Porsche championships for nine years, I fancied a bit of a change. A friend, Guillaume Gruchet, recently joined Radical Challenge so I took a closer look and realised the championship could be a really good option,” says Nick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“I did a trial day at Doinington Park in the SR3 RSX last month. I had a brilliant amount of seat time and, with coaching from Roger Bromiley, I made really good progress. With three races in one day at Oulton Park, I asked Richard to team up with me. Friday testing will be our first chance to get to grips with the car, but with some help from multiple Radical champion, Bradley Smith, we hope to get up to speed. At top ten finish would be nice but we’re coming along to have some fun!”</p>\n\n<p>A bumper day of Radical Challenge action at Oulton Park on Saturday 20 July starts with qualifying at 09:35 ahead of the first 50-minute endurance race at 11.00. The 20-minute sprint race takes place at 13.05, with the final battle of the day at 15.40. Follow the Radical Sportscars social media channels for updates.

Being billed on these high-profile events is a huge coup for Radical, and we can’t wait for our drivers to showcase themselves in front of large spectator crowds– we know they’ll put on a great show.”</p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Tire Motorsport Park date will also act as the first round of the Radical Canada Cup.</p>\n\n<p>As in 2017 each round will consist of three 40-minute sprint races and the series is open to Radical SR3, SR8, SPYDER and RXC cars. The 2017 series attracted 45 competitors from across the United States along with drivers from Canada, Brazil, England and Norway. Along with multiple private entries, each of Radical's North American dealers also fielded teams.</p>\n\n<p>Jesse Menczer (One Motorsport)&nbsp;won the Masters class championship (SR8). Richard Thomas (Wisko Racing) won his second consecutive 1500 title after a hard fought year long battle with Ethan Stone (One Motorsport). Antoine Comeau won the 1340 class championship, even though a broken wrist kept him from participating in the final rounds at COTA.</p>\n\n<p>The full schedule, including two West Coast rounds, will be announced during the PRI Trade Show, Indianapolis, Dec 7-9. Radical will be at PRI with the first full presence for over a decade, showcasing its powertrain capability alongside information on its range of cars and championship.</p>\n\n<h2>2018 Radical North American Championship Provisional Schedule</h2>\n\n<table align=\"left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 600px;\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Rnd 1</th>\n\t\t\t<td>March 23-25</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Circuit of the Americas, Texas</td>\n\t\t\t<td>World Challenge</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Rnd 2</th>\n\t\t\t<td>April 27-29</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Virginia International Raceway, Virginia</td>\n\t\t\t<td>World Challenge</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Rnd 3</th>\n\t\t\t<td>May 18-20</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, Ontario</td>\n\t\t\t<td>World Challenge</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Rnd 4</th>\n\t\t\t<td>July TBA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>TBA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>TBA</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Rnd 6</th>\n\t\t\t<td>August TBA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>TBA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>TBA</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"row\">Rnd 6</th>\n\t\t\t<td>September TBA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>TBA</td>\n\t\t\t<td>TBA</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

          "content": "<p>Going into the weekend Jani Hjerppe had a lead of 44 points, but with double points being awarded for both races at the last event it meant that 112 points were still available, the championship was wide open! Even Sean Simpson sitting in third place could jump up the order with a good weekend and take the honours!</p>\n\n<p>So in Q1, series leader Hjerppe was on track sharing this weekend with GRC regular Mantyla. Also driving in Q1 was James Edmeades sitting in second place with his co-driver Jeff Curtis on 198 points. With only 15 minutes to put down their best lap its was going to come down to the wire. Seven laps in, it was Hjerppe who showed his hand with a 1:25.018, which seemed pretty safe until on his last flying lap Edmeades put in a 1:24.837 to take the pole!</p>\n\n<p>Ten minutes later Q2 started and those with a two driver pairing had to switch. Sean Simpson was very quickly on the pace setting provisional pole on lap 6 with a 1:25.549. Showing great pace for the first time was Steve Adams posting the other front row time. However, Jeff Curtis on the penultimate lap denied Steve that glory, initially pipping him by just 0.05 of a second, and then finding 0.3 more on the last lap.</p>\n\n<p>Race 1 started a few hours later with a bunch of cars running wide whilst jostling for position, with James Edmeades emerging in the lead with Hjerppe right behind him. Newcomer (and on his first ever race start) was Marcus Bamberg, doing very well in the middle of the pack. Steve Adams was in third but had Konstantin Gugkaev chasing him with the gap never more than 0.3 of a second which certainly had Adams feeling the pressure. For 11 laps they were nose to tail, but when Adams came into turn 16 just a little too hot he span out and gifted the place to Gugkaev.</p>\n\n<p>Coming into the pitstops Edmeades handed over to Curtis and Hjerppe handed over to Mantyla, but after two laps the Dream Racing car of Manyla did not come around. The car had been retired on track with a suspension failure! This potentially opened up the race for Jeff to walk off into the lead.</p>\n\n<p>However, Sean Simpson had other ideas, lapping consistently faster than Curtis, putting him on course to be right behind Curtis on the last lap, hoping Curtis would falter! Falter he didn’t, and sure enough Simpson was right in his mirrors on the last lap, but it wasn’t enough, and Curtis sailed over the line 0.0365 ahead for victory. This meant that Edmeades/Curtis now took the lead of the series!</p>\n\n<p>So, the last race of the season saw the grid blasting down to Turn 1, where technically any one of the top three drivers, Hjerppe, Curtis/Edmeades and Simpson, could still take the honours! Indeed, it was Simpson that had the bit between his teeth and lead away from the start, a lead that he would maintain all the way to the flag, great effort, but would it be enough!</p>\n\n<p>It was Adams who got the jump on Curtis and was running second. This would remain until the pitstop with Curtis unable to find a way past. Due to the success penalty Curtis &amp; Edmeades had picked up in race one Adams was able to extend his lead over them, but Hjerppe had slip passed him in the pitstop. So, it was Simpson out front, followed by Hjerppe, Adams and Edmeades some 8 seconds down the road.</p>\n\n<p>Edmeades was able to pull in Adams over a couple of laps, but struggled (as did Curtis) to get past. Nearing the last few laps of the race he found a way past, but Edmeades did not have the pace to get close to Hjerppe. Fastest lap went to Hjerppe and this would prove critical, as that pulled him level on points with Curtis &amp; Edmeades as they crossed the finish line. In this situation Sporting Regulations dictate that points ties are resolved by the driver that has won most races, and in this situation that means Hjerppe takes another series title with 5 wins, over Curtis &amp; Edmeades' 3 wins.</p>\n\n<p>By winning the 2019/20 Gulf Radical Cup in his 240kph, 226bhp two seater Radical SR3, Hjerppe wins the opportunity to race on the famous Silverstone Grand Prix with the Radical UK Factory Team, and Curtis/Edmeades receive a fully funded test in an LMP3 car in Spain with Virage Racing. The 2020/21 Gulf Radical Cup, one of ten Radical championships that run in four continents, will commence in October and will be the 15th continuous season of this very popular, and the UAE’s longest running, circuit race series.</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/gulf-radical-cup\">GULF RADICAL CUP</a>"

          "content": "<p>Unfortunately news had filtered through that Ozzie racer Steve Adams, who was making a return to GulfSport Racing after many years had to make an emergency trip back to Australia and so had to withdraw from the event.</p>\n\n<p>The three hour open pit-lane session started at 13.00 with all drivers taking to the track. Unfortunately newcomer Mohamed Al Kazemi had an off braking into Turn 8 with damage rendering the car out of action for the whole weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Going into Friday it was time for Q1 and Q2. These sessions being only 15 minutes long and just minutes apart are designed to set the grid for Race and 1 and 2 respectively. Just a short blast to see what the drivers can produce!</p>\n\n<p>Q1 saw reigning Champion Jani Hjerppe setting the pace with a 2:17.593 for the Pole, followed by team mate Yousaf and a great lap from Feyzulin for third, his best showing yet. Amir Feyzulin has spent much of the summer competing in the UK Radical series, and clearly put that time to good use, demonstrating impressive pace this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately Cush had a spin under the hotel, ending up on the exit kerb of turn 19. With the yellow flags coming out a little slowly, only seconds after Cush came to rest Shahin came through on a hot lap and could do nothing to avoid heavy contact with Cush. Shahin was able to make it back to the pits for a sidepod change, but Cush sustained more damage resulting in the car missing Q2 while the team worked to replace the front end.</p>\n\n<p>Q2 started only 15 minutes later and it was the chance for the two driver pairings to show what they had. This time it was Sean Simpson setting the pace, however after post qualifying scrutineering the car was presented underweight, meaning Simpson had all his times removed resulting in a pit-lane start for race 2. James Edmeades’s lap of 2.18.717 took the pole in the end.</p>\n\n<p>Race 1 started a few hours later, and it was Hjerppe who took the lead with Feyzulin in second and Yousaf third. Mughal made a bad start dropping to the back with newcomer Francis, both had some work to do to get past Cush and catch up with newcomer Khazzoum. After the pit stops Hjerppe handed the car to Mantylla in the lead but with the great pace of Shahin and Simpson they eventually took the lead so it was a Dream Racing 1, 2, 3!</p>\n\n<p>Race 2 started the following day with Race 1 winner Simpson lining up in the pit lane following his weight infringement from Q2. However he was very determined and all eyes were on him at the start. He lined up behind Neil Clark who also was starting from the pit-lane as a result of missing Q2 while his car was being repaired following his team mate’s accident in Q1.</p>\n\n<p>As the field stormed through Turn 1, its was Usmaan Mughal who had made a flying start getting to third place. However disaster struck when he had to pull his car over due to an electrical fault. Simpson was on a charge setting fastest times while he caught up to the back of the field and had actually got up to 5th place before the pit window opened. Due to the Round 1 success all three Dream racing cars had pit stop time penalties, however with Simpson’s pace it looked liked a podium was still on the cards. As he handed the car to his team-mate it was left to Yousaf to see where he could get to and he wasted no time pursuing the leaders.</p>\n\n<p>Shahin was also on a charge out of the pits taking Ian Roberts and then Curtis. Yousaf was taking about a second a lap out of Roberts and got past him for fourth with one lap to go. So it was the pairing of Hjerppe and Mantyla across the line first, followed by Shahin and Curtis for third.</p>\n\n<p>After reports from official trackside observers and Race Control, cars 26 (Yousaf/Simpson), 96 (Francis), and 24 (Shahin) were all given 3 place penalties for crossing the pit exit line. Shahin was subsequently excluded from the race. That left Curtis being promoted to 2nd and Roberts taking 3rd; all important points for the year ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Reflecting on his first ever race weekend.<strong> Johnny Khazzoum</strong> added:</p>\n\n<p>“It was a great experience being the first race I’ve ever done after many trackdays. It was very challenging and for sure made me more focused on upcoming races. Great organisation and environment. I think this is the closest someone can get to an F1 race feel, Gulf Radical Cup lets you achieve that dream!”</p>\n\n<p>The next race is in three weeks at the Dubai Autodrome on the 22nd November.</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/gulf-radical-cup\">GULF RADICAL CUP</a>"

However the milestones didn’t end there. The NTT IndyCar Series REV Group Grand Prix at Road America, June 20-23, also marked the first time the Radical Cup has supported America’s premier open-wheel series and featured the largest crowd to ever witness a Radical race. With action packed races and multiple race winners in every class, the Radical Cup became an instant crowd favorite and lived up to Road America’s slogan of “Road racing at its best.”\n&nbsp;"

          "content": "<p>As friends and family looked on from the comfort of Radical’s hospitality tent, the drivers and crew had an intense workload with five 40-minute practice sessions prior to qualifying and the typical three 40-minute race format spread over the four days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>1500 Class</h3>\n\n<p>Antoine Comeau (#10 Eastern / Turn 3 Motorsport) entered Round 3 at Road America having won every race of the season meaning it was critical his 1500 class opponents stopped his streak. Jordan Missig (#48 Missig Performance Group / Team Stradale) immediately made his intentions clear, stealing pole away from Comeau midway through the qualifying session.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lining up third in class for Race 1 reigning champion Indy Al Miller’s luck didn’t even last a lap. Miller (#500 Blue Marble Cocktails / One Motorsports) spun out of contention and into the wall on the warm-up lap between Turn 5 and 6.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After the extended pace laps, which were also needed to recover a stranded Richard Durocher (OPMT.com / WISKO Racing), Missig kept his cool and Comeau at bay during lap one and for the remainder of the race. An elated and emotional Missig dedicated his maiden victory in the Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup series to his former teammate and fellow Autobahn member Jeff Green, who was tragically taken in a historic Formula 5000 one year ago.</p>\n\n<p>Behind Comeau, Gustavo Rafols (#28 WISKO Racing) made a stellar pass on Louis Schriber (#111 Shorewood Development Group / Team Stradale) through Turn 14 just before a full course caution was thrown to recover Scott Wagner. The #8 WISKO Racing RXC Spyder had found the tire wall on the exit of Canada Corner while working Lap 13. Rafols was initially awarded third place, however a post-race review confirmed the young Puerto Rican had passed a back-marker under yellow to generate the opportunity. As such he was relegated to fourth and Schriber awarded the podium.</p>\n\n<p>Gerhard Watzinger (#320 CrowdStrike Racing / One Motorsports) was the best of the rest in fifth, with Todd Snyder (#46 Aesthetic Dental Designs / One Motorsports), Richard Thomas (#738 R Ventures / WISKO Racing), Greg Gorski (#24 smokebuddy / One Motorsports), George Kurtz (#04 CrowdStrike Racing / One Motorsports) and Tad Cusack (#115 YETI / Moorespeed) rounding out the top ten.</p>\n\n<p>Missig qualified fastest in class and third on the grid for Race 2, but was baulked by pole sitter Will Lin, who seemed to stutter just before the green flag flew. Classified ninth at the end of the opening lap, Missig’s race went from bad to worse when an upright failure unraveled a strong recovery, which saw him run as high as fourth.</p>\n\n<p>An amazing first two laps from Rafols sent him into the class lead from eighth overall, while Blue Marble’s Miller started carving his way up through the field from the rear of grid. On lap 13 Gorski got caught out trying to pass a back marker around the outside of Turn 14, and found himself momentarily caught in the gravel trap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rafols continued to absorb the pressure from Comeau, and looked to have the race all wrapped up, until Comeau sent his car down the inside at Turn 14 with three laps remaining. While there was a small amount of contact, Comeau made the pass stick and took his seventh win of the season. Rafols was visibly furious with himself for leaving the door open, and a look of unfinished business lingered across his face as the podium ceremony took place. Louis Schriber again took third, while George Kurtz impressed taking fourth in front of CrowdStrike Racing teammate Gerhard Watzinger. Miller completed a strong comeback with a top six finish, and also set the fastest 1500 lap of the race to clinch class pole for Race 3, which featured a mandatory pitstop.</p>\n\n<p>With rain falling as the drivers lined up for the final time, the start was delayed and teams instructed to change on to wet tires. A number of cars were penalized with points deductions for also changing setup, including Comeau. But with the damp track drying quickly, it also appeared those tweaks became their own self-imposed penalty.</p>\n\n<p>While Miller had a disastrous first lap, falling back to 19th, Comeau was the class act, dicing with Jim Booth’s V8 powered SR8 for the outright lead, while Rafols hounded Terry Olson’s SR8. Rafols was the first of the 1500 leaders to pit and change to slick Hankook rubber. Comeau, meanwhile, elected to run longer on wet weather tires but started to struggle for pace, and the undercut worked for Rafols who came out in front. With Race 2 still well and truly front of mind Rafols fended off Comeau who tried everything including a ‘Hail Mary’ into the final corner from two car-lengths back. The move left Comeau running wide in the grass and Rafols to take his first victory since stepping up to the 1500 class.</p>\n\n<p>Missig salvaged third while Nate Smith (#19 Wisconsin Brewing Co / Speed du Nord) completed an extremely strong series debut to cross the line in fifth, however he was later relegated to sixth for having too many crewmembers working on his car during the pit stop. That promoted Schriber and Miller to fourth and fifth, respectively.</p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n    <p><a class=\"button button--revealer\" data-panel-reveal=\"reveal-panel-883\" data-reveal-label=\"Read More\" data-hide-label=\"Hide It\">Read More</a></p>\n    <div id=\"reveal-panel-883\" data-reveal-copy=\"\">\n      <h3>Masters Class</h3>\n\n<p>Dave Tweedlie (#65 Team Tweedlie Racing) immediately impressed in his first outing for the year. Jim Booth (#63 McDonald’s / WISKO Racing) momentarily led as he completed lap two, but pole sitter Tweedlie dominated Race 1 to take the outright victory and top honors in the Masters class.</p>\n\n<p>Will Lin (#66 RISE / Radical Northwest), who led the class championship heading into the round at Road America, drove an outstanding race. After being sidelined in qualifying as his team frantically rebuilt his gearbox and having to start from the back of the grid, he drove to sixth outright, and fourth in class. Knowing that Lin was storming through the field Terry Olson (#16 RTR) pushed hard (and at times too hard) but held on to take the final step of podium.</p>\n\n<p>Such was Tweedlie’s cruise to victory in Race 1 he would only start fifth on the grid for Race 2, while Lin’s efforts were further rewarded with fastest lap and pole. However Lin’s disastrous start allowed Booth, Tweedlie and Olson to capitalize. Lin then re-passed Olson for third on lap four, while Tweedlie attack Booth. On Lap 9 Booth received his first reprieve when Tweedlie made an uncharacteristic mistake, spinning on the exit of Turn 6. Then Lin gave Booth another free pass by spinning on Lap 14. With a large lead Booth took the outright victory and Masters class win from Olson and Lin.</p>\n\n<p>Tweedlie was back on pole position for Race 3 and as the first man to explore the wet track conditions he came unglued in Turn 1. He returned to as high as seventh overall prior to his pitstop, however shortly after changing back to dry tires Tweedlie suffered a dramatic tire failure and spin at approximately 150mph on the main straight. Lin was another to fall back on the opening lap, and mounted a strong recovery to finish third in class.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the pitstops it appeared Booth may have been in the box seat, however a stellar stop put Olson into the lead¬, which he would never relinquish. It was Olson’s first win this year and since forming his own team led by Crew Chief Dean Jones, who accepted the trophy on Olson’s behalf.</p>\n\n<h3>1340 Class</h3>\n\n<p>A large number of entrants from Autobahn Country Club saw the 1340 class swell at Road America. Mike Anzaldi (#61 Team Stradale) showed strong pace during qualifying before Tim Sanderson (#07 Northwest Atlantic Motorsports) cemented pole position. Mike D’Ambrose (#6 Team Stradale) looked set to outqualify his son, until Mike Junior went faster still in the closing minutes. That prompted Senior to push again, but this time he pushed too hard, and he obliterated the front of his Radical SR3 1340 at Turn 3.</p>\n\n<p>With all the parts on hand Team Stradale made quick work of Senior’s car overnight, and he rewarded them with fourth place in Race 1. Meanwhile D’Ambrose Junior backed up his strong qualifying performance with second place, and Kevin Poitras (#73 Post Plastics / Radical Canada East) made a mark during his return to the series with a podium finish. However, neither of them had an answer for Canadian Tim Sanderson, who took his maiden series victory. So strong was the competition in the 1340 class, points leader Eric Wagner (#10 Eastern / Turn 3 Motorsport) could only manage eleventh.</p>\n\n<p>Sanderson’s dominance continued in Race 2. From pole position he again won convincingly. This time it was D’Ambrose Senior who joined Mike D’Ambrose Junior (#60 Team Stradale) on the podium, after relinquishing second place to his son with just a couple of laps remaining.</p>\n\n<p>The Radical Canada East team continued its strong form with Ron Keith (#25 MBRP) finishing fourth, while Anzaldi and Andrew Marks (#44 Team Stradale) completed the top six and Wagner, John Rante (#99 Team Stradale), Poitras and Tony Weir (#30 Team Stradale) made up the top ten.</p>\n\n<p>During Race 3 Sanderson elected to stay out and run long on the wet weather tires. As with Comeau the strategy didn’t pay off and while he led the 1340 class prior to stopping, he was only seventh as the checkered flag fell. Sixth was Anzaldi, while Wagner finished fifth, with Chris Kemp (#153 Team Stradale) in fourth. The Radical Canada East crew high-fived after their pitstops, and rightly so. Their slick work helped propel Keith into third and Poitras into second. However, it was D’Ambrose Senior who capitalized the most from the mandatory stop, clinching victory in the final race of the weekend.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nThe Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup now heads west to Portland International Raceway, August 9-11, and Sonoma Raceway, September 27-29, before completing the year at Circuit of the Americas, November 14-16, supporting Creventic’s Hankook 24H Series.&nbsp;</p>\n\n    </div>"

          "content": "<p>The announcement comes just weeks after the curtains closed on another strong year for Radical’s premier North American series. Professional teams from IMSA and Road to Indy including Cameron Racing, Moorespeed, Newman-Wachs, One Motorsports and Turn 3 Motorsport helped swell the grids, which averaged 25 cars in 2019. Supporting IndyCar for the first time at Road America, Radical Cup set a record starting its largest ever field of 38 cars. The season then ended on high with all three races broadcast across the internet complete with commentary from Radio Le Mans personalities John Hindhaugh and Shea Adams.</p>\n\n<p>Confirmation the series will once again star alongside the Creventic 24H Series at Circuit of the Americas ensures live broadcasts will continue to be a feature of the Radical Cup.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n“The 2020 season will undoubtedly capitalize on the growth and success the Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup North America series has seen this year,” <strong>said Radical Sportscars North American manager Tom Drewer.</strong><br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n“After a late switch to SCCA Pro sanctioning for 2019 we managed to put together a stellar calendar combining bucket list tracks and high-profile events. We’re excited to be able to do this same in 2020, which will include new experiences for our returning racers.”<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nRoad Atlanta will be one such new experience. Radical Cup last visited the home of Petit Le Mans in 2017, and next year will share the bill with Formula Race Promotions and SCCA Pro’s F4 and F3 Championship. Held on Easter Weekend, the event will be run Thursday through Saturday to ensure families can still spend Easter Sunday together.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe remaining four rounds of championship will be announced shortly.</p>\n\n<p>For all the latest information follow the official social media channels of the Blue Marble Radical Cup and visit the Series page by clicking the button below.</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/radical-cup-north-america\">RADICAL CUP NORTH AMERICA</a>"

          "content": "<p>\"The Radical Canada East Cup’s seventh season featured strong participation with a championship battle that went down to the very last race. To match the high level of competition, we are making a number of improvements for 2020 which will bring the Radical Canada East Cup more in line with Radical Championships in the USA and around the world” commented Radical Canada East President Robert Burgess.</p>\n\n<p>Starting on May 9th at Canadian Tire Motorsports Park, the championship will run five events at four different circuits and finish on October 4th. Each race weekend will consist of practice, qualifying sessions and three races, as well as a test day held the Friday before each event. Due to the extensive track time participants will now also have the option of running just one day or having two drivers share a car to compete in the event.</p>\n\n<p>As has become tradition, the series will commence at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park in May. The Radical Canada East Cup will then head to Shannonville Motorsport Park in June for the Summer Challenge and to Mont Tremblant in July for the Summer Classic.</p>\n\n<p>New for 2020, the series will then feature at the Calabogie Cup Race Weekend for the penultimate round, where it will star alongside IMSA’s Porsche GT3 Cup and the Canadian Touring Car Series. This flagship August event is expected to be the highlight of the season and will likely draw a number of additional competitors from the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The championship will then return to Canadian Tire Motorsport Park for the CASC Celebration event and season finale. Finishing in October will also allow Canadian drivers to join their US counterparts for the last round of the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America series at Circuit of the Americas with the International 24H Series, November 12-14.</p>\n\n<p>Championship points for the Radical Canada East Cup will be awarded based on the CASC point system. Each driver must also have a valid CASC or equivalent racing license and all participating cars must conform to the Series Rules, which ensures parity amongst the Radicals.&nbsp; The complete rule set can be found on the CASC website: <a href=\"http://www.casc.on.ca/roadracing_rules\">www.casc.on.ca/roadracing_rules</a></p>\n\n<p>More information on Radical Canada East is available at <a href=\"http://www.radicalcanada.ca\">www.radicalcanada.ca</a> and on the company’s social media channels: @RadicalCanada&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2020 Radical Canada East Cup Schedule:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>May 9-10 Canadian Tire Motorsports Park</li>\n\t<li>June 6-7 Shannonville</li>\n\t<li>July 24-26 Le Circuit Mont Tremblant</li>\n\t<li>Aug. 28-30 Calabogie</li>\n\t<li>Oct. 3-4 Canadian Tire Motorsports Park</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For further information contact:<br>\nRadical Canada East<br>\n39 Ashwarren rd.<br>\nNorth York, ON<br>\nM3J 1Z7<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:info@radicalcanada.ca\">info@radicalcanada.ca</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.radicalcanada.ca\">www.radicalcanada.ca</a></p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/canada-cup\">RADICAL CANADA EAST CUP</a>"

          "content": "<h4>QUALIFYING</h4>\n\n<p>A really close first qualifying session of the season, with the top ten covered by just 2.7s – saw 2019 vice-champion Jerome de Sadeleer take pole for Race 1 and 2. Jerome pipped fellow SR1 Cup graduate Mark Richards by just over half a second to complete the front row, just ahead of former LMP3 racer Jason Rishover, and last year’s SR1 Cup champion Shane Stoney. 2019 race-winner Marcus Clutton and 750MC Bikesports regular Chris Preen completed the top six.</p>\n\n<h4>RACE 1</h4>\n\n<p>From the light, de Sadeleer was able to hold a stable lead over Clutton, up to second over the opening stages of the race. However, the deployment of the Safety Car for Brian Caudwell’s retirement intervened in the run-up to the pit stop window, and was bad timing for Jerome and Marcus, with the rest of the field benefitting by a lap advantage on the pitstops.</p>\n\n<p>After the Safety Car lights had gone out and the pit stop dust had settled, Jac Constable led the race followed by Stoney, Rishover, Preen, De Sadeleer and Clutton. Stoney hit the front when Constable pitted and proceeded to maintain a gap to De Sadeleer and Clutton, but under pressure from Jerome, Stoney ran wide late in the race, enabling De Sadeleer to regain the lead and ultimately the win, with Clutton in close attendance and Stoney a few seconds behind. Preen, Rishover and John Caudwell completed the top six, with Icelandic racer Audunn Gudmundsson (sharing with Works Team instructor Tom Ashton) taking the Team Challenge spoils.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>RACE 2</h4>\n\n<p>A slow start by both polesitter De Sadeleer, and Stoney on the second row, resulted in the pair languishing down the order at the end of lap 1 of the day’s 20-minute sprint. This enabled Clutton and Richards to produce a racing masterclass, the two of them never separated by more than 0.6 seconds for the entire race whilst building a healthy gap from the rest of the field. Rishover enjoyed a quiet race in third, 4.6s ahead of Constable, Brian Caudwell and de Sadeleer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All eyes were on the mid-pack battle for seventh between Preen, and father and son Rod and Elliot Goodman, crossing the line just tenths apart. Stoney had patiently made progress back up the order from a distant tenth, gaining the fastest lap in the process, only to be thwarted by a mechanical failure late on.</p>\n\n<h4>RACE 3</h4>\n\n<p>Three races, three different winners.</p>\n\n<p>With Race 2’s results forming the grid for Race 3, Clutton and Richards would form the front row. This time it was Constable who took the spoils, with Clutton and De Sadeleer only a few seconds behind. After an early Safety Car period, once again it was Clutton and Richards who took up the running, with De Sadeleer, Constable, Elliot Goodman, Ashton and Stoney close behind. The pit stops - and first application of Success Seconds this season - meant that as the race progressed, Constable was desperately fending off Richards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Their battle enabled Clutton and De Sadeleer to close up so that when the chequered flag finally dropped, the lead three crossed the line separated by tenths. Richards and Stoney held station to the flag in fourth and fifth respectively, with Gudmundsson/Ashton competing a hat-trick of Team Challenge wins in sixth overall.</p>"

In the eight years since the series began, this will be the first time the SR1 Cup has raced on the now iconic Brands Hatch Grand Prix circuit, whose layout and drastic elevation changes makes it one of the most demanding tracks on the calendar.</p>\n\n<p>Pinkerton may be the championship leader, but Warriner comes into the weekend carrying the momentum of two victories from the non-championship invitational round at Silverstone and should be one to watch this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, the Radical Works Team is joined by Sam Ashton, who makes his season debut after ending 2019 third in the championship.</p>\n\n<p>While not on track, the SR1 field will no doubt have their eyes on 2019 champion Shane Stoney in the Challenge Championship.</p>\n\n<p>Stoney has pushed champion elect Marcus Clutton throughout 2020 and comes to Brands Hatch looking to seal the runner-up position. Just 28 points further back is Jason Rishover, who managed some spectacular drives in the wet at Snetterton to overcome a difficult qualifying. With Brands Hatch GP experience already under his belt, Rishover will no doubt once again be fighting at the front of the field.</p>\n\n<p>Having missed the Snetterton weekend, Scott Sport duo Neil Glover and Jason Green return for the season finale, once again going head to head against fellow team entry Audunn Gudmundsson and Tom Ashton.</p>\n\n<p>Qualifying for the SR1 Cup begins at 9:00am, with the first race getting underway at 11:40am. The Challenge Championship has a slightly later start at 10:15am for qualifying and 1:15pm for race one.</p>"

Others to watch in Platinum include Scott Wagner, who impressed with a podium at the last event, ex-ALMS champion Jon Field (Scott Wagner Racing), and Jim Booth (McDonald’s / WISKO Racing), who currently lies second in class points.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/240/original/Radical-CupNA-COTA-3.jpg?1626373638 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/240/std/Radical-CupNA-COTA-3.jpg?1626373638\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/240/std/Radical-CupNA-COTA-3.jpg?1626373638\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>PRO 1500</strong></p>\n\n<p>Radical’s 1500cc Hayabusa powered SR3 is the British marque’s most popular model globally, and the Blue Marble Radical Cup is no different, with 15 cars entered this weekend. At least six drivers are genuine contenders for race wins in this highly competitive class. Young-gun Gustavo Rafols (WISKO Racing) and seasoned racer Gregg Gorski (smokebuddy / ONE Motorsports) are tied in points after the first six races, and amazingly both sit at the top of the table with just a single win to their names.</p>\n\n<p>Three more junior drivers hope to gain ground on the lead pair this weekend. Palmer Miller (Radical Texas / Esses Racing), who has taken two victories this season, needs a consistent weekend, as do fellow race winners Alex Morton (Team Stradale) and Noah Ping (Revogenex / Comprent Motor Sport). All three have shown amazing pace but need to reign in their youthful exuberance which has led to a number of unforced errors in the first two rounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br>\nAnother driver looking to make amends is 2020 runner up Steve Jenks (Audien Hearing / Group-A) who has shown staggering speed at times this year, but has not had consistent pace or the best of luck thus far. Others to keep an eye on in PRO 1500 are Nate Smith (Largersmith / Speed du Nord), who scored two podium finishes at Road America, as well as Texas / Esses Racing teammates and locals Bake Mycoskie and Kit Leslie.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/239/original/Radical-CupNA-COTA-2.jpg?1626373638 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/239/std/Radical-CupNA-COTA-2.jpg?1626373638\" width=\"600\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/239/std/Radical-CupNA-COTA-2.jpg?1626373638\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>PRO 1340</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 1340 class is also expected to be fiercely fought. Vince Switzer and CROWN Concepts, who took a trifecta of wins during Round 1, return to the championship to take on young-guns Christian Weir (Power Equipment Direct / Team Stradale) and Zac Ping (Revogenex / Comprent Motor Sport), who duked it out at Road America. Weir clinched two victories in Wisconsin, while Ping is still looking to secure his first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Switzer’s teammates, Jason Plotke (Apex Motor Club / CROWN Concepts) and Chris McMurry (prisma / CROWN Concepts) also have their eye on the top step of the podium, especially the latter who is a former Sebring 12 Hour winner. The same goes for points leader Mike Anzaldi (Emmett’s Energy / Anzaldi GP), who has scored a podium in each race so far this season, including a win at Road America. Reid Stewart will be another to watch, as he makes his series debut for Radical New York and Group-A Racing. With a newcomer and the Apex Country Club contingent back onboard, ten PRO 1340 cars will be taking to the track this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>The event commences Friday with a staggering 2.5 hours of testing, before qualifying and two races on Saturday and the final race Sunday morning.

          "content": "<h3>Radical Cup – Jonathan, can you please provide us with a brief history of Group-A Racing?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - We started in 1996, as a program for my older brother’s racing in USF2000. We started running customers in 2009 when I stepped up into pro racing as a driver and at 17 years old, I also took over the day-to-day operations of the team. We have been very fortunate to run a variety of sports car and open wheel series, from Trans-Am, F4, F2000, USF2000, World Challenge, and Formula Lites, winning many races along the way. Naturally we are intense competitors, so we don’t feel like we’ve ever won enough, but when I take a step, I can’t help but be very proud. Most importantly, the thing I am proud of is after being in this business so long, it’s hard to find somebody to say something bad about us.</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup – When did you join Radical Cup?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - We joined the Blue Marble Radical Cup in 2020 when going through the process of getting our Radical dealership. We joined with a one car operation in PRO 1500 class with Steve Jenks. It was a fantastic start. In fifteen races we earned seven podium results, winning the final race and just missed out on the championship, finishing second.</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup – Why did you join Radical Cup?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - For the business of Group-A Racing, I was looking for another opportunity, specifically in sports car racing. Sports car racing has been on such a tremendous rise the last ten years not only in North America, but globally, and it’s only continuing to grow. As a business, it offered us to continue to work with young drivers, the same as we did in our open wheel history but also have a more mature driver base for some more stability in the business. When I came across the Radical Cup, I was blown away to see they recently had 37 cars at Road America, plus they were a support series to the NTT INDYCAR Series. Then I realized there was a dealership opportunity for us in the North East. Our dealership just turned two years old this past week and it’s been the best decision of my life. It has transformed our business, allowing us to expand at a rate that would not have happened if we wouldn’t have made the decision to make the switch and join the Radical Cup program.</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup – How has the 2022 season been for you, and can you tell us a bit about your current drivers?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - This year we have been running five drivers including Steve Jenks (Platinum Class), Reece Everard (PRO 1500), Aurora Straus (PRO 1500), Jack Yang (PRO 1500), and Reid Stewart (PRO 1340). It is a big undertaking, but we are up for the constant challenge of both winning and success.</p>\n\n<p>We still have Sonoma to go, and the World Finals in Vegas, but there are so many highlights for us. At Barber Motorsports Park and Road America, we had all our drivers on the pole position in all three classes for the same race. It was very cool to have a sweep like that. We have come up just short of winning all three classes in the same race, which has never been done before and a goal of ours for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Entering Aurora Straus and instantly having her on the podium all three races during her debut at Watkins Glen is another great highlight of our season as well. The amount of progress she made from her first test in March to her first race was huge and very rewarding for all at Group-A Racing. Reid Stewart came to us last year and where he is today– a multi race winner– is a night and day difference. Jack Yang never drove a car before getting a Radical from our dealership, yet he has been on the podium many times this year and earned a win on track at Utah, and has also being racing in the UK Radical series. All these success stories really showcase our coaching and how we develop our drivers into podium winners.</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup – What are the future goals of Group-A Racing?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - No doubt, to win a championship. We have been the bridesmaid many times in many series including Radical Cup but haven’t won the title yet. That needs to change and is another major goal that we are working very hard to achieve, and heading into the final round we are in the lead of the Platinum class with Steve Jenks, while leading the Teams’ championship in PRO 1500.</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup – What do you do for Group-A Racing locally to attract drivers to your program to build Radical Cup perception?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - We are a team in Radical Cup, and a dealer for Radical Motorsports in the North East. We do about eighteen demo days a year at the various country club tracks in our region, promoting the brand, creating car sales and with the car sale customers, comes new potential drivers for the Radical Cup. We also have been active in NASA and SCCA in our region, again promoting the brand, promoting Radical Cup, moving drivers up from club racing to pro racing and more. I have been using my contacts from my fifteen years in the open wheel arena to spread the gospel of Radical Cup, get them in for a test, or one-off race weekend. I am a member at New Jersey Motorsports Park (NJMP), which gives me access to 45-member days a year for people to come and do tests. Reece Everard is a great example of an open wheel contact that learned of Radical Cup through us. He came to NJMP to test last October and then joined us for a 2022 campaign.</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup – What is the environment like at Radical Cup?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - On track the competition is very intense and everybody is out for themselves. However, things are extremely friendly in the paddock, there is a Blue Marble cocktail party every Friday, all the teams have lunch together and often we go out to dinner with fellow competitors. The Radical Cup program has a more family feel than any other series I’ve been involved in. We all get along very well, and we help each other when needed. There are always smiling faces in the paddock which is nice to see. We honestly have the best of both worlds, fun and friendly, but intense and close hard racing. I’ve never experienced such a thing before and think the competitors that join the series will be surprised on the great atmosphere.</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup – What are the key benefits of Radical Cup over other series?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - I love how Radical Cup offers tremendous benefits for both young career aspiring kids and the more gentlemen drivers. We average over five hours of track time per weekend, triple header events, live stream, numerous INDYCAR weekends, fantastic cars with large fields of thirty cars or so most events, what’s not to like? &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the young kids we have three platforms of speed for them to grow into straight from the karting level. While it’s sports car racing, it’s a prototype with a very similar driving experience to open wheel. The alumni have proven the series does a tremendous job of getting drivers ready for higher levels of both open wheel and sports car racing. The Radical Cup program is a tremendous teaching platform used around the world. In Radical Cup the drivers also get to learn multi-class race traffic management, how to perform pit stops under pressure with the race three mandatory pit stop, and yet all done at a budget of basically the most affordable open wheel series in the world, but with much faster cars.</p>\n\n<p>For the gentlemen drivers, what else can you do for this budget: track time on high profile events with INDYCAR and at this performance. The Radical SR10 has on-par performance with LMP3 and GT3, but our budgets are the same as Mazda MX-5 Cup, so it’s a tremendous value for the dollar. You don’t have to deal with sharing your car, no BOP, plus who doesn’t want to go 175MPH at a track like Road America?</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup – If you could change one thing about the Radical Cup, what would you change?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - It is hard to pinpoint one thing but if I had to single out something I wish that it was more well known that the Radical Cup program is an affordable race series that challenges drivers and helps them learn skills to be the best they can be.</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup – Anything else of importance?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Jonathan Scarallo</strong> - When friends of mine from other arenas check out the paddock, they are always shocked by the quality of the paddock. The paddock presents itself well with hospitality tent, professional transporters, awnings etc. But the quality of crew members in this series is immense. Under my own tent our Engineers and Mechanics have successful INDYCAR and Formula One experience. Lenny Tumenas, who’s been full time in Radical with me since we joined in 2020, was with Chip Ganassi Racing and on Tony Kanaan’s car this year at the Indianapolis 500. Even the others are so deep with talent. Dave O’Neil with Esses Racing built HAAS F1 from the ground up with Gunther Steiner. Thomas Knapp with Wisko Racing has put cars on the pole position at the Indy 500 and won countless junior open wheel races. Steve Cameron, is a Radical dealer on the West Coast and enters his team. It’s impossible to summarize all the success his programs have had here in America in both open wheel &amp; sports cars. It really is such a tremendous paddock that I am very proud to be a part of. When you win here you have accomplished something!</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/858/original/1.jpg?1663944668 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/858/std/1.jpg?1663944668\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/858/std/1.jpg?1663944668\"></p>\n\n<p>Catch Group-A Racing at the final round of the Blue Marble Radical Cup at Sonoma over the October 29-30 weekend, and the Radical World Finals, November 8-13 in Las Vegas.

Seemingly ever growing in popularity, Austin saw the highest car count yet for 2021 with 34 drivers taking to the track including an influx of local Texans. Gustavo Rafols dominated the PRO 1500 class, taking pole position and all three wins to give himself maximum points over championship rival Gregg Gorski. Fourteen-year-old Cristian Weir again showed why he’s destined to be a star of the future with two wins in PRO 1340, and it could have been three if not for a technical infraction by his team. The Platinum class spoils were shared between former ALMS champ Jon Field, points leader Indy Al Miller and home-town hero Judd Miller. However, it was another Texan, Willie Putrajaya, who turned the most heads with a standout performance earning him two podium finishes."

However perhaps a bigger frustration to the older generation of drivers in the 1340cc SR3 ranks was the raw pace of young Christian Weir (Power Equipment Direct / Team Stradale), who continued the dominance he displayed at Road America. He was a staggering 1.8 seconds clear of Chris McMurry–&nbsp;a former Sebring 12 Hour class winner and father of Weathertech star Matt McMurry– and secured his second Motul Pole Award of the season.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/279/original/Rad-NACup-COTA--37.jpg?1626784747 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/279/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--37.jpg?1626784747\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/279/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--37.jpg?1626784747\"></p>\n\n<p>Weir then led Race 7 of the championship from start to finish, only to have his celebrations soured when his car failed tech. This promoted McMurry (prisma / CROWN with Apex) to the win, from Zac Ping (Revogenex / Comprent Motor Sports) and Mike Anzaldi (Emmett’s Energy / Anzaldi GP). Ping’s result was one of redemption after having to give up a position following a pass under yellow, and a drive through for multiple track limit violations.</p>\n\n<p>A standout drive in Race 8 saw Weir claw his way from the back of the grid to clinch victory and the Sunoco Hard Charger Award. This time it was McMurry’s teammate and fellow Apex Country Club member Vince Swizter (CROWN with Apex) in second, with Anzaldi again securing third.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Another fastest lap of the race secured Weir the class pole for Race 9, while his team further redeemed themselves with a solid pitstop and strategy to help ensure the youngest driver in the field secured his fourth win of the season. McMurry added to his trophy cabinet with second, and Zac Ping completed the podium.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/264/original/Rad-NACup-COTA--22.jpg?1626784734 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/264/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--22.jpg?1626784734\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/264/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--22.jpg?1626784734\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PRO 1500</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tied in points heading into the weekend, COTA was going to be critical for both Gregg Gorski (smokebuddy / ONE Motorsports) and Gustavo Rafols (WISKO Racing). Qualifying went the Puerto-Rican’s way and he was rewarded with the Motul Pole Award, while Gorski had to settle for fourth fastest in the highly competitive class, with two more young-guns, Noah Ping and Palmer Miller increasing the gap to his championship rival. Fifth fastest was Alex Morton (Team Stradale), who was then caught out by a minor issue and the tight turn arounds between sessions, preventing him from taking the green in the first race. Rafols found himself mixing it up with the SR10 of Scott Wagner, who eventually became a convenient buffer between himself and Gorski, who worked his way to secure a solid second place. This was helped by the demise of Noah Ping (Revogenex / Comprent Motor Sports) on lap 2, who spun and then collected Blake Mycoskie while reentering the track, and a tough race for Palmer Miller, who fell to fifth in class. Alain Derzie (ONE Motorsports) capitalized on the commotion to finish third, with Steve Jenks (Audien Hearing / Group-A Racing) in fourth while Nick Pearson (Team FURY) completed the top six.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/268/original/Rad-NACup-COTA--26.jpg?1626784738 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/268/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--26.jpg?1626784738\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/268/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--26.jpg?1626784738\"></p>\n\n<p>Nate Smith (Lagersmith / Speed du Nord) and David Alban (RingPower / WISKO Racing) were both scratches for Race 8, while David Flynt (WISKO Racing) spun on the opening lap, but that was only the beginning. By lap five multiple cars were stranded off track, including Steve Jenks who was running third at the time. After an initial safety car, the race was red flagged momentarily to preserve maximum running time, and racing resumed with 15 minutes left on the clock. Throughout, Rafols remained in command to take his third win of the season. It was heartache for Noah Ping, who stopped in the final turn as the white flag came out. Palmer Miller received a big cheer from his home crowd for second place, while Gorski kept himself in contention for the championship with another podium. Pearson had another solid result with fourth, with Morton fifth and Richard Durocher (OPMT.com / Team FURY) six.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/259/original/Rad-NACup-COTA--17.jpg?1626784731 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/259/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--17.jpg?1626784731\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/259/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--17.jpg?1626784731\"></p>\n\n<p>Second fastest in class during the second race, Gorski found himself better placed for the final race of the weekend. He tailed Rafols in the stint before the mandatory pitstops and came out of pitlane within striking distance. He was tantalizingly close, however Rafols kept calm under pressure to clinch his third win of the weekend. On the podium, Gorski was satisfied with his second place, and Palmer Miller added to his points haul with third. It appeared to be either Derzie or Jenks on the podium until the pair banged wheels on the final lap in what was deemed a racing incident and they had to settle for fourth and fifth, respectively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PLATINUM</strong></p>\n\n<p>Radical Texas / Esses Racing fielded a total of eight cars at COTA, which particularly boosted the Platinum class with Todd Solomon (SR10), Willie Putrajaya (SR8 RSX) and Philip Berber (SR8) joining full season entrants Palmer Miller (SR10) and Conrad Park (RXC). As expected, the series regulars set the pace early in the weekend, but it quickly became apparent there was a dark horse amongst the Texan talent.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/257/original/Rad-NACup-COTA--15.jpg?1626784729 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/257/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--15.jpg?1626784729\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/257/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--15.jpg?1626784729\"></p>\n\n<p>Louis Schriber again showed his speed and took his second pole position of the year. After dualling with Jon Field (Scott Wagner Racing) during the opening laps, Schriber settled into the lead before lady luck dealt the Shoorewood Development Group Racing driver another blow, with debris puncturing his radiator. While Field took over the lead, and Indy Al Miller (Blue Marble / One Motorsports) fended off Judd Miller, Park sent his RXC into a spin over the bumps through the esses. A moment for Indy Al late in the race, while pushing hard to pass Field, allowed Judd through, but brake fade meant Judd had to ease up, and Indy Al reclaimed second place. Yet the real eye opener was Willie Putrajaya, who had started seventh in class, had not only rocketed up the field but past Judd Miller on the final tour to take the final step of the podium. Putrajaya’s efforts were also rewarded with Race 7’s Sunoco Hard Charger Award.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/261/original/Rad-NACup-COTA--19.jpg?1626784732 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/261/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--19.jpg?1626784732\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/261/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--19.jpg?1626784732\"></p>\n\n<p>While setting the fastest lap in the first race, Schriber sidelined for the second, leaving a three-way tussle between Field, Al Miller and Judd Miller for the win. Philip Berber had a big scare with a rear brake bleed nipple failure resulting in a highspeed hit with the Techpro barriers at turn 11. His car was just many that led to the red flag.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After racing resumed Indy Al Miller secured another victory the brand new 380lb-ft, 425bhp Radical SR10, from Field and Judd Miller. Jim Booth finished fourth, with Park and Putrajaya rounding out the top six.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/271/original/Rad-NACup-COTA--29.jpg?1626784740 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/271/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--29.jpg?1626784740\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/271/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--29.jpg?1626784740\"></p>\n\n<p>Critically though, Putrajaya had put in a stellar lap to ensure he’d start the final race from the front row. A spin in the opening lap for polesitter Al Miller dropped him to sixteenth overall at the end of lap 1, and Judd Miller was in command from teammate Putrajaya. While Miller attempted an overcut and led the race briefly during the spate of pitstops, he conceded in parc ferme that Radical Texas were just too strong and had to settle for third place. Meanwhile, Judd Miller and Putrajaya thrilled their fans with a Radical Texas one-two, particularly Putrajaya’s standout performance. Jim Booth again finished fourth, while Todd Solomon scored an impressive fifth in his series debut. Louis Schriber salvaged some points with sixth place in a borrowed car, with his drive from 32nd to13th overall earning him the Sunoco Hard Charger award.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/277/original/Rad-NACup-COTA--36.jpg?1626784744 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/277/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--36.jpg?1626784744\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/277/std/Rad-NACup-COTA--36.jpg?1626784744\"></p>\n\n<p>With close points battles in each of the three classes, the Blue Marble Radical Cup now heads to New Jersey Motorsport Park to star alongside Road to Indy, on August 27-29.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/race_results/documents/000/000/098/original/2021-Radical-Cup-RD3-Results.pdf?1626555982\">View the full COTA results by clicking here.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/race_results/documents/000/000/094/original/2021-Radical-Cup-Points.pdf?1624283074\">View the 2021 Radical Cup North America championship points table by clicking here.</a></p>\n\n<p>Images: <a href=\"https://www.apexatxmedia.com\">Tracie Leanne/APEX ATX Media</a></p>"

Scott Wagner (SWR) and Todd Solomon (Radical Texas/ESSES Racing) finished a strong fourth and fifth, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Race 14 saw Field find another level. He drove off into the distance, winning by a staggering 47 seconds over Judd Miller and Louis Schriber.</p>\n\n<p>Reportedly Field was clocked at 1:18 laps, which matched Riley Dickinson’s unofficial laps during testing, but a fault with Field’s transponder meant he would start the third race of the weekend from the back of the grid.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/428/original/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica-7.jpg?1632819163 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/428/std/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica-7.jpg?1632819163\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/428/std/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica-7.jpg?1632819163\"></p>\n\n<p>From the pole, Miller led until diving into the pits for his mandatory stop. Meanwhile Field had passed 12 cars on the opening lap– earning him the Sunoco Hard Charger Award– before dispatching his fellow Platinum drivers to sit in third on lap five. Staying out, Schriber capitalized on a near perfect stop and a full course caution as the pit window closed to leapfrog into the lead over Miller.</p>\n\n<p>Field then tried a daring move on Miller in turn 1, but it all went horribly wrong and tumbled him down the order.</p>\n\n<p>By that time Race Control had also confirmed Miller had misjudged his stop, and while he crossed the line in second place, the Texan was quickly relegated to sixth place.</p>\n\n<p>This promoted Scott Wagner into third and Jim Booth into second behind race winner Louis Schriber, who secured his first victory since Road America.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/430/original/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica.jpg?1632819165 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/430/std/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica.jpg?1632819165\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/430/std/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica.jpg?1632819165\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>PRO 1500</strong></p>\n\n<p>Throughout practice it seemed as though class points leader Gustavo Rafols (WISKO Racing) had an edge, however when it counted Palmer Miller (Radical Texas/ESSES Racing) found a 1:23.550 to take the Motul Pole Award by a mere seven-hundreds of a second.</p>\n\n<p>In the first race Rafols took the lead on the opening lap, while further down the pack Richard Durocher (OPMT dot com/Team FURY) had contact and smoke, possibly from bodywork rubbing on a tire, could be seen. Whether related or not, as he started Lap 2 Durocher’s car left the track at Turn 1 resulting in a heavy impact with the tire wall. Instantly the safety car was deployed to neutralize the race.</p>\n\n<p>When the race resumed, so did the battle for the lead. However, Rafols had Miller’s match and in the end his margin of victory was over 2 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Third placed Nate Smith (Largersmith Canning/Speed du Nord) impressed with his pace and was named the Sunoco Hard Charger for multiple position gains. Alex Morton (Team Stradale) fended off Gregg Gorski (smokebuddy/ONE Motorsports) for fourth, while Nick Pearson (Team FURY) and Alain Derzie (ONE Motorsports) completed the top-six.</p>\n\n<p>Rafols started the second race from pole, but this time Miller got the jump into Turn 1, as did Alex Morton. Soon Rafols got back past Morton, and set his sights on Miller.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/424/original/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica-3.jpg?1632819160 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/424/std/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica-3.jpg?1632819160\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/424/std/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica-3.jpg?1632819160\"></p>\n\n<p>The young Texan kept his cool and, more critically, kept Rafols behind to take his third win of the season. Nate Smith backed up his Race 13 result with another podium, while Gregg Gorski took fourth. Alex Morton had to settle for fifth, and Nick Pearson again took a top six finish.</p>\n\n<p>Starting from pole for the final race, Rafols quickly found himself in a three-way fight with Miller and Smith. Impressively, Smith passed both the young-guns during lap 8 to be leading the highly competitive class just before the pit window opened.</p>\n\n<p>This however, is where Smith’s race unraveled, with his team miscalculating the pit delta. Smith came out about six seconds up the road, before Alain Derzie found the gravel trap on the long approach to pit lane and activated a full course caution.</p>\n\n<p>As the green flag flew, Smith pitted to take his penalty, which left Rafols to fend off Miller for the win. Morton completed the PRO 1500 podium, while Pearson just missed out on collecting hardware yet again. Nate Smith salvaged fifth, with Gorski in sixth.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/429/original/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica-8.jpg?1632819164 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/429/std/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica-8.jpg?1632819164\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/429/std/Radical-CupNA-RoadAmerica-8.jpg?1632819164\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>PRO 1340</strong></p>\n\n<p>Points leader Mike Anzaldi (Emmett’s Energy) appeared to have a slow start to the weekend at Road Atlanta, although he later admitted he wasn’t showing his full hand during practice. Nevertheless, in qualifying he didn’t have the pace to match young-gun Zac Ping (Revogenex /Comprent Motor Sports), who took the Motul Pole Award with a 1:26.332.</p>\n\n<p>Zac Ping’s contact on the opening lap of Race 13 took him out of contention, and left Anzaldi to win comfortably from his closest rival in the points, Zac’s father, Jeff. Jason Greewood (Greenwood Racing) completed the podium, with John Pearson (Team FURY) finishing in fourth and Bob Grecyzn (Mellow Mushroom/WISKO Racing) fifth.</p>\n\n<p>The younger Ping made amends in Race 14, storming up through the field to earn the Sunoco Hard Charger award. However, he would never catch Anzaldi, who again took a comfortable win. Finishing third, Jeff Ping joined his son on the podium, with Greenwood and Pearson rounding out the top five.</p>\n\n<p>Starting the final race from the pole, Zac Ping was no doubt hoping for a breakthrough win, while farther Jeff needed a win– and Anzaldi to crash out– to keep his championship hopes alive. Neither would occur.</p>\n\n<p>Anzaldi drove a flawless race and gained at least a second over Zac Ping in the pitstops to take his third win of the weekend, his sixth in a row and his seventh win of the season to clinch the 2021 PRO 1340 class title.</p>\n\n<p>Finishing second and third respectively, Zac and Jeff Ping again flanked Anzaldi on the podium, while Pearson edged out Greenwood for fourth place.</p>\n\n<p>The Blue Marble Radical Cup series next heads to Sebring International Raceway for its season finale on Nov. 17-19, where the series will support the Creventic’s Hankook 24H Series.</p>\n\n<p>All three races at Sebring will be live streamed and will feature commentary from Radio Le Mans. All Radical racers are invited to participate, regardless of whether they have previously raced in the championship.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/race_results/documents/000/000/104/original/2021-Radical-Cup-RD5-Results.pdf?1632664592\">RESULTS:&nbsp;Road Atlanta</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://POINTS: Click Here\">POINTS:&nbsp;Click Here</a></p>"

My love for Radical was reinforced when I purchased a new Porsche 911 GT3 RS, I took it straight to Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire. After 10 laps of disappointment over braking distances and corner speeds, I decided to park it up and jump back into my Radical for the remainder of the day and I’ve never looked back since. Once you experience a Radical on track there really is nothing else to beat it.”</p>\n\n<p>Radical Sportscars Global Sales Director, Dan Redpath, echoed Chris’ comments.</p>\n\n<p>“Chris is a very well-known member of our UK paddock and bringing him in alongside the factory sales team is something we’ve been investigating for a while, so it’s fantastic to now have this formally confirmed. The UK market has been successful for us in 2021, and now with the strongest model line-up that Radical has ever had in its 24-year history, we’re looking forward to working in partnership with Performance Time.”</p>\n\n<p>Performance Time will work in partnership with Radical Sportscar’s Regional Sales Manager for the UK, Dominic Lee, who will continue to be the main point of contact for direct sales and is based at Radical Sportscars’ Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, head office and factory.</p>\n\n<p>Performance Time can be contacted at <a href=\"mailto:dominic.lee@radicalsportscars.com\">c</a><a href=\"mailto:contact@performancetime.co.uk\">ontact@performancetime.co.uk</a>&nbsp;or on 07766 465555</p>\n\n<p>Domininc Lee can be contacted at <a href=\"mailto:dominic.lee@radicalsportscars.com\">dominic.lee@radicalsportscars.com</a> or on 07769 351783 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/198/original/PT-03-Web.jpg?1624639124 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/198/std/PT-03-Web.jpg?1624639124\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/198/std/PT-03-Web.jpg?1624639124\"></p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Having chalked up five class wins over the years, Radical Sportscars are considered a fixture at the NASA 25 Hours of Thunderhill, yet an outright victory has evaded the British marque since the event’s inception in 2003.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Reigning ESR champions CrowdStrike / One Motorsports are hopeful 2018 could be the year, while for rookie Radical entry Turn 3 Motorsports the first priority is simply to take the checkered flag.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Both teams feature star studded line-ups including 2013 Freedom 100 Indy Lights winner Peter Dempsey, Indy Lights driver Victor Franzoni, 2016 Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona winner Kenton Koch (LMPC class), 2017 Pirelli World Challenge GTSA Champion George Kurtz and Radical Cup North America alumni. &nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nThe sixteenth running of the grueling 25 Hours of Thunderhill – the longest automobile race in the United States – takes place on December 1-2. At least three Radical SR3s are entered in the expected 50-plus car field made up of GT and prototype machinery from amateur and professional drivers and teams alike who, if they finish, will have completed a distance equivalent to driving across the United States from coast to coast.</p>\n\n<p>Leading the charge is the #44 CrowdStrike / One Motorsports Radical SR3 entry of Spring Mountain Country Club members George Kurtz and Gerhard Watzinger, along with pro driver Kenton Koch and One Motorsports team principal Jeff Shafer. For Kurtz, this will be his sixth attempt at an outright victory. For Shafer, this year will be his tenth attempt at the title, either as a driver or as team manager.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“This is a special event for us as each person has competed in it for some time,” commented Kurtz, who by day is the CEO and co-founder of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. “Each year we have come up a little short of the overall win. We are hoping to put an outright victory in the books in 2018!”</p>\n\n<p>The team’s second car, the #67 One Motorsports Radical SR3 of Dave House, Paul LaHaye, Mikel Miller and Ethan Stone will undoubtedly also be in the running. House was part of last year’s class winning driver line-up, and LaHaye and Stone both have multiple Thunderhill starts to their names.</p>\n\n<p>Like last year, One Motorsports has chosen Radical’s diminutive 1340cc powerplant to power its pair of SR3 chassis, while upgrades to the car include bespoke endurance lighting and electrical system, long-range fuel tank and real-time telemetry, so the team can see exactly what is happening out on track.</p>\n\n<p>“We know from the Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup how reliable the 1340 engine is,” explained Shafer, “and last year we proved less really is more when the 1340 lasted the distance and we won the ESR class.”</p>\n\n<p>“There are always faster cars,” Shafer added. “And the Radical SR3 is one of the fastest, but speed alone never seems to win this race. Reliability does. Thunderhill has a way of throwing a new problem at you every year, and we’ve learnt from every one of them. Hopefully this year we’ve got every eventuality covered.”</p>\n\n<p>Shafer’s extensive knowledge has been tapped into by Thunderhill newcomers Turn 3 Motorsports, which is led by former Indy Lights racer Peter Dempsey. He is the son of Cliff Dempsey, owner of the famous UK-based Cliff Dempsey Racing Formula Ford 1600 team.</p>\n\n<p>“As a team we have reached out to One Motorsports to assist us with the build of the car,” said Dempsey. “We have [also] teamed up with Newman Wachs Racing for this event, and they have also brought a lot of experience to the table. [And Chicago Radical dealer] Team Stradale have been very helpful with supplying us with all the parts to make this come together.”</p>\n\n<p>The driver line-up of the #10 Eastern Shipping Worldwide / Turn 3 Motorsports Radical SR3 entry also has a wealth of experience, not to mention a truly international flavor with Eric Wagner (USA) joining Antoine Comeau (Canada), Victor Franzoni (Brazil) &amp; Peter Dempsey (Ireland).</p>\n\n<p>Wagner, the president of Eastern Shipping Worldwide, a global leader in shipping and logistics, and Comeau, an index options trader at Optiver, are Autobahn Country Club members and Radical Cup North America graduates, with Comeau claiming the 2017 SR3 1340 Class Championship.</p>\n\n<p>Dempsey and Franzoni both have Indy Lights and Pro Mazda experience, Franzoni having won the Pro Mazda championship in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>For Comeau, who is one of the most winning drivers in Radical Cup history, “The goal is the same as every race before, to win it!”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However, Dempsey – who is famous for recording the closest finishing margin in Indianapolis Motor Speedway history (0.0026 secs whilst taking victory in the 2013 Freedom 100 Indy Lights race) – knows better than most that winning sometimes involves a little luck, as will surviving the ‘25’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Our first goal will be to settle into the race and stay out of trouble while looking after the car. It will be a huge achievement to get to the finish of this race. Hopefully if we do that, we will have a chance of standing on the podium.”</p>\n\n<p>Follow the progress of the Radical teams in the 2018 NASA 25 Hours of Thunderhill Presented by HAWK Performance with live video coverage, live timing, live streams and live social media posts.</p>\n\n<p>Event Coverage and Broadcast Schedule:<br>\n<a href=\"https://nasa25hour.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://nasa25hour.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Live Event Video Coverage:<br>\n<a href=\"https://livestream.com/drivenasa/25hour\" target=\"_blank\">https://livestream.com/drivenasa/25hour</a></p>\n\n<p>Live Timing:<br>\n<a href=\"https://racehero.io/orgs/nasa-norcal\" target=\"_blank\">https://racehero.io/orgs/nasa-norcal</a></p>\n\n<p>Live Onboard Streams:</p>\n\n<p>#44 Crowdstrike / One Motorsports Radical<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCT-Zr6lplPkgzvxXbTjUqQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCT-Zr6lplPkgzvxXbTjUqQ</a><br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n#67 One Motorsports Radical<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Xqu_p6tRPrqexMVdvURhg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Xqu_p6tRPrqexMVdvURhg</a></p>\n\n<p>#10 Eastern Shipping Worldwide / Turn 3 Motorsports Radical<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/turn3motorsport\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/turn3motorsport</a></p>\n\n<p>Radical Sportscars North America Social Media:<br>\nTwitter: @RadicalCUP &nbsp;Facebook: @RadicalCUP &nbsp;</p>"

          "content": "<p>There’s been nothing to choose between the two this season, each sharing the spoils so far. But with Cadwell ranking among Harper-Ellam’s favourite tracks, the 2017 Shootout winner held the upper hand against circuit debutant Pinkerton and planned to take full advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Harper-Ellam got his Cadwell campaign off to a flying start by maintaining his 100 per cent SR1 Cup pole-winning record, turning that into an emphatic fourth win of the season. The Brackley ace managed&nbsp;to fend off a flying rolling start from Pinkerton, the duo running wheel-to-wheel before Harper-Ellam secured the inside line and the lead heading in to Coppice.</p>\n\n<p>From there the 20 year-old set a blistering pace aboard the Gen 2, 175bhp SR1. Despite running on old rubber and on the back foot in terms of circuit knowledge, Pinkerton (Ramsey St Mary’s) delivered a faultless drive to a second place points haul, his best race lap just 0.103 off Harper-Ellam’s.</p>\n\n<p>Will Hunt (Brighton) scored his third consecutive outright podium having applied race-long pressure to Chris Short (Wolverhampton). But a moment for Short approaching Barn in the final moments allowed Hunt to sneak through to the final step on the rostrum and cement his clean sweep of Rookie Cup class victories.</p>\n\n<p>Slightly disappointed with his race one form, Pinkerton was determined to bring the fight back to Harper-Ellam around the tight and twisty, undulating Louth circuit. With Pinkerton once again nailing the start, the top duo ran millimetres apart down the pit straight and in to Coppice before Harper-Ellam moved ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Harper-Ellam may have taken the early advantage, but by lap four Pinkerton had posted the top race lap time. From there the pair swapped fastest laps as the gap ebbed and flowed by mere fractions of a second, Pinkerton edging within 0.6 seconds with six minutes remaining before losing over a second lapping traffic.</p>\n\n<p>Mounting a final push, Pinkerton posted one more purple lap on the penultimate tour before traffic looked to play a part once again, this time with Harper-Ellam losing ground. Although Pinkerton tried to take full advantage to draw alongside heading towards the line, Harper-Ellam hung on by 0.233 seconds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overcoming his race one disappointment, Short bounced back with a stellar race two start to overhaul and keep Rookie Cup rival Hunt at bay for third.</p>\n\n<p>Julian Lay (Bampton) sealed his fourth consecutive class win to move to the top of the Fangio class battle, whilst Mark Williams (Dalkeith) took his second top-six finish of the weekend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver quotes:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ryan Harper-Ellam (Winner, race one and two):</strong> “Race one was good fun, I love it here,&nbsp; I always have. The circuit suits me and the SR1 is awesome round here, it moves around just enough for it to be so much fun with enough grip and power to be really quick through the fast stuff.</p>\n\n<p>“I knew James was a bit more hungry in race two, as he knew what I was going to pull out of the bag, so the first corner was a lot tighter. There was just enough room for both of us, and the rest of it was just back and forth. He got a bit unlucky with traffic and then at the end I came up to some traffic and was basically at a standstill and he caught me, so I’m relieved to win. The battle between us is making the championship much closer, a lot of fun and it’s putting on some great racing. For me, I’d never say no to it being a little easier, but it’s fun so I can’t complain.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>James Pinkerton (Second, race one and two):</strong> “It feels great to retain the championship lead. I knew it was going to be a hard weekend, Ryan’s king round here. I knew I had to really switch something on for the second race and it came together. I love the track, and I got some good times so I’m happy with it. I’m really happy to get the fastest lap, it’s a shame on the last lap I had a 27 second lap [on the cards] and we just both hit a bit of traffic which put an end to that, but I’m still happy.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will Hunt (Third, race one):</strong> “It was very hot out there today! I didn’t get a good start and Chris got me, so I spent most of the race playing catch-up. Sadly towards the end of the race he made a little mistake, which gave me the opportunity to take the place but I suffered a bit of rear end damage in the process. But I’m really happy to get third and extend my lead in the Rookie Cup.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chris Short (Third, race two): </strong>“I’m so happy with this result, it makes up for the disappointment of race one where I was third for all of the race until spinning at the last corner, so I’m really pleased to be going home with one of these trophies. I got another good start and got ahead, and just had to get my head down and concentrate on what I was doing because I knew that Will was on a very similar pace. He was literally in my mirrors for the whole 20 minutes, but I kept on track. I’m really chuffed to be back on the podium, probably the best fun I’ve had in the car actually.”</p>"

Johnson was on track for a win in Race 1, but with less than 10 minutes remaining he ran wide through Turn 14, allowing reigning class champion Terry Olson (Team Fury) to draw first blood, and prove the SR8s would remain highly competitive during the 2021 season.</p>\n\n<p>Behind Johnson in second, Jon Field (Scott Wagner Racing) finished third and was awarded the Sunoco Hard Charger award for his efforts from the rear of the grid, while Al Miller (Blue Marble / ONE Motorsports) clawed his way up to fourth after a minor technical infraction saw him start at the back. Jim Booth (McDonald’s / WISKO Racing) finished fifth after being sent into a spin by Palmer Miller.</p>\n\n<p>With an outstanding lap of 1:22.980 Terry Olson started Race 2 from pole, but was relegated to third by the SR10s of Johnson and Miller. Pushing hard, Olson found himself rolling backwards in the pitlane entry after a spin. Field, who again had to start rear of field, also had trouble in Turn 14, but worked his way back through to again claim the Sunoco Hard Charger award. On the last lap he found himself fighting for third, and when Schriber left the smallest of gaps, the former ALMS champion pounced, pushing his way through to take the final step of the Platinum podium to join Johnson and Miller. Johnson’s win was redemption for Race 1 and the first for the new SR10 anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Indy Al Miller’s fastest lap saw him start Race 3 on the pole, and after One Motorsports timed his pit stop to perfection, he gave the SR10 its second win of the weekend. Schriber again impressed after a year away from Radical Cup competition, taking second, while Johnson finished making&nbsp;it three podium finishes with third. Olson was solid in fourth, while a post race penalty for Field for shorting the mandatory pitstop time relegated him to fifth in class.</p>"

Steve Jenks worked his way through to second place, while Gorski fended off Rafols, Alex Morton (Team Stradale) and Jesse Menczer (DiscTech / ONE Motorsports) for third.</p>\n\n<p>Miller started Race 2 from the pole, but Jenks and Ping both worked their way by, while Rafols and Gorski also remained in the hunt. Jenks built up a commanding lead until a yellow flag for a stricken Mike Anzaldi bunched the pack and allowed Ping to get a run into Turn 1 as the race resumed. The pair touched twice with the second impact breaking Jenks’s upright, ending his race and bringing out another full course caution. The livestream vision made the move look quite controversial, but Ping’s onboard was more ambiguous. Nevertheless he was reprimanded and received an additional 5 point penalty for his role in the incident.</p>\n\n<p>A one-lap dash to the checkered flag saw Palmer Miller fall back while Gorski, Morton and Menczer capitalize in the Turn 6 hairpin, before Miller tried to make amends with a rimshot around the outside through Turn 14. However he got onto the marbles, which sent him into a dramatic spin.</p>\n\n<p>There were no such dramas for Noah Ping, who added his name to the Radical Cup race winners list, with Gustavo Rafols finishing second and Gregg Gorski in third.</p>\n\n<p>Jenks’s impressive pace of 1:25.436 gave him the pole for Race 3, and he led from Morton and Miller before the round of mandatory stops. Ron Fletcher went for a wild ride over the crest of Turn 13, glanced the wall, took out an advertising board, but lived to fight another day. Rafols churned out a sequence of outstanding laps, including a 1:24.834, to rocket up the order, as did Palmer Miller, who found himself in the lead as the leaderboard cycled through.</p>\n\n<p>With just minutes to go, the battle between Menczer, Morton and Gorski heated up in the with Gorski elevated to third behind second placed Rafols, while Palmer Miller had another massive moment late in the race. This time it was exiting the final corner, but he survived the wild ride to take his second win of the weekend.</p>"

However he could never catch his fellow Apex Motor Club member Vince Switzer, who impressed with an instant win in his Radical Cup debut.</p>\n\n<p>Race 2 was a similar story with Switzer again fending off McMurry for the win, but this time it was Jason Plotke in third, giving Crown Concepts all three steps of the podium. Jeff Ping finished in fourth place followed by Greenwood and Grecyzn.</p>\n\n<p>The pitstops in Race 3 altered the order and Jason Plotke was the first PRO 1340 to receive the checkered flag, however he had shorted his pitstop by a considerable amount and was relegated to fourth.

Challenge</strong></p>\n\n<p>Matt Bell took a step closer to sealing the 2021 Radical Challenge title at Donington Park, with two class wins from his three races.</p>\n\n<p>Michael Clark’s RXC Spyder was on pole for the first race, with 360 Racing’s Mark Richards alongside, while Mechtech’s Anthony Ayres was out in a brand new SR3 XX, heading row two from Works driver Jason Rishover.</p>\n\n<p>Ayres managed to build a good first lap lead in the opening race, with RAW Motorsport’s Bell in third, pressing hard to find a way past Clark.</p>\n\n<p>The straightline speed of the Spyder proved decisive when a challenge into Goddards on lap two saw Clark emerge as the new leader, having almost touched Ayres as he squeezed down the inside.</p>\n\n<p>Rishover had also closed on Bell, and the top four pulled clear, with Chris Short heading the next quartet from John MacLeod, Dean Warriner and Jerome de Sadeleer.</p>\n\n<p>But de Sadeleer was starting to lose touch, which allowed Richards to close, but after he went off at Coppice, Richards set Warriner as his next target.</p>\n\n<p>While Clark took a comfortable overall win, Ayres was well clear in second overall and the Sprint Class winner. “The new car made all the difference, now I am doing the job I knew I could do,” said Ayres.</p>\n\n<p>Bell managed to shake off Rishover to win his class from third, “Once I was clear of Jason it was okay, as I couldn’t have coped with him behind me the whole race,” he reckoned.</p>\n\n<p>Rishover, Short and MacLeod completed the top six, with de Sadeleer having taken Warriner for seventh at McLeans on lap 11.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Preen and James Winslow completed the top 10, after Richards recovered from a first corner gravel excursion, only to vacate seventh when “it died.”</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/404/original/2021-Radical-Donington--7.jpg?1632220873

second race when MacLeod’s car wouldn’t start, and he had to be pushed away.</p>\n\n<p>Clark led from the start with Bell and de Sadeleer duelling for second and Rishover under pressure from Short for fourth.</p>\n\n<p>Short was through at Melbourne, but couldn’t shake off his rival. “I don’t know how he still managed to brake and get around the corner after that,” said Rishover.</p>\n\n<p>De Sadeleer started to threaten Bell and managed to successfully squeeze down the inside at Goddards. “I knew he was coming for me, maybe I defended too late,” Bell admitted.</p>\n\n<p>“I had managed to hang on to him and he made one mistake, so I was through,” de Sadeleer replied.</p>\n\n<p>Preen was in sixth, but his race ended when Warriner lost it under braking at Goddards and contact was made.</p>\n\n<p>Out came the Safety Car and from the green flag, Bell was alongside de Sadeleer down the Craner Curves, and back ahead going into the Old Hairpin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Clark took his second overall win of the weekend, with Bell topping the SR3s, just 0.477 secs ahead of de Sadeleer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rishover, Short and Tyler were the rest of the top six, with Ayres seventh, after being squeezed out earlier at Melbourne.</p>\n\n<p>Warriner was eighth, with Richards ninth having passed Elliot Goodman on the last lap, despite visiting the first corner gravel again and going agricultural at Coppice to avoiding a spinner.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\"

after six laps when the SR1s of Mark Williams and James Hadley crashed out.</p>\n\n<p>From the restart Bell was under pressure from de Sadeleer, but Clark shot past them both into the Esses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>De Sadeleer lost out at Melbourne, “I had two wheels on the grass, just too greedy,” he admitted after dropping to fifth, behind Rishover and Short.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the race distance being shortened Bell made his stop after three laps, but was run off the track by a backmarker after rejoining.</p>\n\n<p>With Clark taking his third overall win, Rishover topped the SR3s for the first time. “I had a good first part and then no one could catch me, I was really on it,” he said.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\"

complete the podium. “Lots of pressure at the end from John, we both had lock ups and I think he may have missed a gear,” said Short.</p>\n\n<p>Bell finally came home in fifth, from Richards and de Sadeleer, with Elliot Goodman, Jacek Zielonka and Rod Goodman completing the top 10.</p>\n\n<p>Richards received a post race penalty for not serving a stop go, dropping him to 11th&nbsp;behind Steven

separated Lay and rival Will Hunt going into the contest, with both drivers eager to take home the spoils.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Polesitter Lay made the best of the start in race one, making an early break with only Daryl De Leon sticking with him.</p>\n\n<p>Frazer McFadden was third, before Nick Zapolski led a four-car train for fourth, from Mackenzie Walker, Hunt and Andy Lowe.</p>\n\n<p>Lay’s lead suddenly grew when De Leon lost drive and pulled off after three laps.</p>\n\n<p>A two-lap safety car period followed but after shaking off a quick challenge from McFadden, Lay was soon back in charge.</p>\n\n<p>Hunt had got Zapolski for fourth from the green flag and quickly closed in on Walker, sneaking past on lap nine.</p>\n\n<p>Lay was clear to take the win, but as Hunt challenged McFadden’s second place into Melbourne on the last lap, Walker got alongside too.</p>\n\n<p>All three were locked together as they approached Goddards. “When I went for the brakes I heard the rear

James Sweetnam and Peter Tyler are also running with Works in the latest spec Radical SR3 XX, and Peter Brookes completes the line-up.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/211/original/Web-Radical-SnettR3-Friday-8.jpg?1625238792 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/211/std/Web-Radical-SnettR3-Friday-8.jpg?1625238792\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/211/std/Web-Radical-SnettR3-Friday-8.jpg?1625238792\"></p>\n\n<p>Chris Preen, running with Valour Racing, is fresh from a strong showing at the Radical Summer Cup and will be one to watch as he seeks to capitalise on his mid-season momentum.</p>\n\n<p>Completing the Challenge class line-up is Mectech Motorsport’s Anthony Ayres, and Steven Lake in his Radical SR3 representing data capture and analysis supplier Aim Technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The Radical Challenge races on Saturday 12.30 and 14.45, with the Challenge Enduro scheduled for 11.45 on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical SR1 Cup</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the Radical SR1 Cup the question is can anyone end Will Hunt’s unbeaten record this year?</p>\n\n<p>The Scorpio driver has won four from four so far, leaving what can only be described as a dominant stamp on the championship so far.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/205/original/Web-Radical-SnettR3-Friday-3.jpg?1625238776 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/205/std/Web-Radical-SnettR3-Friday-3.jpg?1625238776\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/205/std/Web-Radical-SnettR3-Friday-3.jpg?1625238776\"></p>\n\n<p>RAW’s James Lay will be challenging Hunt hard, giving a series of strong performances despite having only made his car racing debut during Round One at Snetterton in June.</p>\n\n<p>After his double class win at the Radical Summer Cup, Track Focussed driver Frazer McFadden is on form, but will have teammates Dean Warriner and rookies Ben Stone and Alex Spooner looking to challenge.

          "content": "<p>It was two wins out of three at Snetterton for 360 Racing’s Jerome de Sadeleer, as the Radical Challenge made its season debut in glorious Norfolk spring sunshine.</p>\n\n<p>Former championship runner-up Matt Bell was the star of the first sprint race, back in a RAW Motorsports Radical SR3 RSX after a six-year absence.</p>\n\n<p>Bell had led from pole, pursued by de Sadeleer, until the race was red flagged after six laps.</p>\n\n<p>From the restart Bell took charge again, but de Sadeleer found his path blocked by the RXC Spyder of Michael Clark, and recovered well down the order after a grassy moment.</p>\n\n<p>Bell took the win by over four seconds from Masters class winner Clark, with debutant Anthony Ayres’ Radical SR3 in third, the Club Sprint class winner. “I was trying so hard not to exert myself, but the car was really good though,” said Bell.</p>\n\n<p>De Sadeleer managed to recover to recover to fourth, after demoting Chris Preen on the last lap and Jason Rishover fought his way into fifth, as John MacLeod completed the top six.</p>\n\n<p>In the second of the Club Sprint races the top three got a break on the opening lap, with de Sadeleer ahead into the Wilson Hairpin, from Bell and Clark.</p>\n\n<p>It was a dominant win for the 2019 runner-up de Sadeleer, having increased his winning margin to over 13 seconds in the final laps of the race, with Bell comfortably retaining second.</p>\n\n<p>“It was a good clean start, and once I had the lead, I just managed the gap and pushed hard when I needed to,” de Sadeleer explained.</p>\n\n<p>Clark had a fairly solitary race in third, winning the Masters class, but had the duelling MacLeod and Chris Short closing in on him at the end.</p>\n\n<p>Spencer Bourne rounded off the top six, while in seventh Ayres won the Club Sprint class again.</p>\n\n<p>It was a mixture of Radical’s SR1, SR3 and RXC Spyder models in the 45-minute Club Enduro, with driver changes and pitstops coming into play.</p>\n\n<p>The top three once again made an early break, but it was Clark ahead this time, from Bell and de Sadeleer, with Short running solo back in fourth.</p>\n\n<p>Clark’s Radical RXC Spyder was especially strong down the straights, with the nimbleness of the smaller SR3s coming to the fore through the corners.</p>\n\n<p>After a number of half attempts, on the sixth lap Bell tried a move into Murrays and was left out on the grass, after contact with Clark, while de Sadeleer then snatched second.</p>\n\n<p>“I had to hit the brakes hard to avoid Matt, but I was being patient and knew what he was trying to do,” de Sadeleer explained.</p>\n\n<p>Clark’s car suffered damage, and was forced to pull off and retire two laps later.</p>\n\n<p>De Sadeleer was in charge for the rest of the race, and following the stops, went on to take his second win of the day by just over 13 seconds from Bell.</p>\n\n<p>Short had moved up to third after Clark’s demise, but admitted he should have pushed harder. “I had the place but just didn’t pull away enough.”</p>\n\n<p>After the stops, Short lost out to the duelling Macleod and Preen, who shared a number of exchanges before Macleod got clear and Preen was given a drive through penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Short therefore came back to take fourth, with Preen fifth on track, before a track limits penalty dropped him to 10th, leaving Spencer Bourne and Elliot Goodman to complete the top six.</p>\n\n<p>In the Enduro class for the Radical SR1, it was a win for Ben Stone/Ryan Harper-Ellam, by 3.6 seconds over Frazer McFadden, with Dean Warriner/Marcus Clutton finishing third.</p>"

          "content": "<p>After a difficult first outing at Oulton Park, which was hindered by a snapped drive-chain in the first race of the season, Harper-Ellam has been playing catch-up to Pinkerton, who was a double winner in Cheshire.</p>\n\n<p>However, SR1 Shootout winner Harper-Ellam’s title aspirations received a huge boost following his own double victory last time out at Snetterton.</p>\n\n<p>The results mean the championship battle is turning out to be a straight fight between two drivers in differing machinery. While the SR1 Cup is a single-make championship, the introduction of the new Gen-2 machine – powered by the same 182bhp 1340cc RPE engine and six-speed sequential Quaife gearbox –&nbsp;has produced some variety within the grid.</p>\n\n<p>Harper-Ellam, who handles the newer Gen-2 car, now trails Gen-1 SR1 driver Pinkerton by 26&nbsp;points heading in to the third round of the campaign.</p>\n\n<p>“Snetterton was a dream weekend for me, and really worked wonders for my season,” says Harper-Ellam. “The weekend was run in changeable conditions, and to get a win in the wet first race really boosted my confidence. I’ve not done a lot in the wet in my career, so you could say it’s a weakness of mine.</p>\n\n<p>“Silverstone will be a different matter though, and I can’t get carried away as there’s still a long way to go in this championship. James is remarkably consistent, so wherever I finish he’ll likely be on or around the podium, so catching him will still be very tough. Hopefully I can get a few more wins at my home track to help close the gap.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s taken a while to learn about the car and get used to how it moves around, how the tyres behave and how to get the best out of the brakes. While it looks like a head-to-head fight between James and I, drivers like Chris Short are getting faster with each outing too.”</p>\n\n<p>Hot on the leading pair’s heels will be both Will Hunt and Short. Hunt boasted some single-seater experience before signing up for his first full season of racing in the SR1s this year, and was twice a podium finisher at Oulton. A tough weekend at Snetterton has limited him to fourth in the points, but he has the speed to upset the established order.</p>\n\n<p>Short sits third in the championship and also has a podium finish to his name this term, and will no doubt be hungry for more.</p>\n\n<p>The midfield battle is just as fraught, with Mark Williams and Gavin McAlpine constantly closing the gap to the frontrunners. Then there’s the Fangio Trophy division for drivers aged 45 or over. Peter Devlin leads that, ahead of David Tagg, Paul Clark, the absent Chris Preen and Julian Lay.</p>\n\n<p>The field swells to 14 cars for this weekend with newcomers Ross Elliott, Adarsh Radia, Andrew Ritchie and Richard Wilson joining the fray.</p>\n\n<p>The SR1 Cup action kicks off at Silverstone on Saturday 23 June with qualifying at 09.00, ahead of two 20-minute races at 12.05 and 15.10 (all timings remain provisional). Live timing is available via <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.tsl-timing.com</a> Race highlights will also be uploaded to the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/RadicalSportscarsUK\" target=\"_blank\">Radical Sportscars YouTube </a>channel.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Having twice been denied the laurels last time out at Brands Hatch, Jackson arrived at Spa intent on making amends and shaking the monkey off his back. The RAW Motorsports charge began by topping an incredibly close third round qualifying session to secure pole by just 0.064 seconds from Jérôme de Sadeleer, with Steve Burgess only 0.148 further back in third.</p>\n\n<p>The combined field of SR3 Challenge and European Masters SR8 machines got clean away for the first rolling start of the Radical Festival weekend. Once the frantic opening lap action played out and outright pole sitter, Alex Mortimer in the development SR8, and reigning Masters Champion Jim Booth streaked away, Jackson led from de Sadeleer.</p>\n\n<p>A conservative start from Burgess, however, meant that the current title leader found himself sandwiched in a three-way fight for third between Kristian Jeffrey and Spencer Bourne. Although Burgess looked promising to pass, his plans were spoiled by man on the move Stuart Moseley, who carved his way through to Challenge third and the Team class lead before the pit stops.</p>\n\n<p>With the furious action unfolding behind, Jackson was able to edge out a two second advantage over de Sadeleer, leaving the home race debutant to push hard before opting for an early stop, only for his strategy to be thwarted due to a stall leaving the pits. That gave Jackson the breathing space he needed to negate the five second success penalty carried over from Brands Hatch, leaving the reigning Vice Champion to enjoy a clear run to the flag.</p>\n\n<p>The pit stop cycle complete, Burgess made a brilliant recovery from his maximum 20 second success penalty, following his second round hat-trick. The former double Radical Champion caught and took John MacLeod before pulling off an awesome move around the outside of Moseley’s teammate, Brian Caudwell, at Malmedy for fourth in class.</p>\n\n<p>That dropped Caudwell into the clutches of MacLeod and Mark Crader, ensuring a griping closing stage jostle for fifth. A run wide from Caudwell at Pouhon on the penultimate tour allowed MacLeod and Crader to complete the top six, but Caudwell had still done enough to secure the Team Challenge class spoils.</p>\n\n<p>Having proved the ongoing development of the Radical SR8, Mortimer peeled off into the pits to ensure Andrew Ferguson finished first on the road to take an impressive Invitational class victory from the back of the grid following early race issues, ahead of Booth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver quotes:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominik Jackson:</strong> “It's fantastic to take my first Radical Challenge win around Spa. Finally! It was a little bit difficult with the SR8s in front of us because they can be a bit slower under braking in the corners and then have the advantage on the straights. So I was trying not to trip over them in the first two corners, particularly through Eau Rouge. I got hampered a little bit but so did everybody else so it was OK. From there it was just managing the tyres and slightly tweaking the driving style as the race went on.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jérôme de Sadeleer:</strong> “That was a lot of fun! The pace was good, I was able to keep up with Dominik for most of the first half of the race but then, unfortunately going out of the pits, I stalled the car and had to do a reset. It probably cost me seven or eight seconds and so that was a bit of a shame. But I'm still learning the trade and second place at Spa is nothing short of beyond the goal I had coming into the season.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kristian Jeffrey:</strong> “It was really good race today. Last year we didn't really do too well, but we got the car dialled in. We still need to find some more time. I think we need about half a second or a bit more to get to the leaders. Dom and Jérôme are very fast this weekend, so we'll see what we can do tomorrow.”</p>\n\n<p>The Radical Festival action at Spa continues on Sunday, with the 20-minute sprint race at 10.30, ahead of the final endurance showdown at 16.15 (local time).

Richards and de Sadeleer recently shared a Fun Cup car in the support race for the 24 Hours of Le Mans last month, but the former teammates are sure to become firm opponents this weekend at Donington.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>RAW Motorsport drivers John Macleod and Chris Short have both shown good pace this season, but they’ve not always been blessed with the luck to go with it. They are currently tied for fifth in the Championship and are both capable of strong podium finishes, so will be ones to watch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Radical Sportscars official sales partner Chris Preen, from Valour Racing, is a regular top-six runner, and Track Focused’s Dean Warriner will be ever-competitive as he gets to grips with his new Radical SR3 XX. Having graduated from the Radical SR1 Cup, Warriner debuted the latest-generation SR3 XX at the previous round at Silverstone GP and is sure to find increasing speed with every lap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Peter Tyler and Peter Brookes join again from the Radical Works Team, 360 Racing’s line-up is completed by Wesley Fongenie, and Steven Lake joins from AiM Technologies. Anthony Ayres is out again with Mectech Motorsport, and finally, Phil Brown joins with RJ Motorsport.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/394/original/Reduced-D8F_7907.jpg?1631793467 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/394/std/Reduced-D8F_7907.jpg?1631793467\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/394/std/Reduced-D8F_7907.jpg?1631793467\"></p>\n\n<p>The battle at the top of the Radical SR1 Cup could hardly be closer as the field arrives for the championship decider, with RAW Motorsport’s James Lay sitting just a single point ahead of Scorpio’s Will Hunt.</p>\n\n<p>With next month’s Spa Francorchamps weekend designated as a non-championship round for the Radical SR1 Cup, the winner is set to be crowned this weekend at Donington Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hunt showed total domination over the early parts of the season by taking clean sweeps at several rounds, but a sustained riposte from Lay has seen him make up the difference. The racing between these two is first-class with both young-guns showing incredible respect during millimetre-close racing, and their battle will undoubtedly prove one of the highlights of the weekend.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/397/original/Reduced-D81_5022.jpg?1631793470 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/397/std/Reduced-D81_5022.jpg?1631793470\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/397/std/Reduced-D81_5022.jpg?1631793470\"></p>\n\n<p>Mackenzie Walker of Road to Race managed to upset the form book last time out, winning at Silverstone GP. But he sits fifth in the Championship currently, behind Track Focused’s Frazer McFadden and Ben Stone, the latter heading the Rookie Championship.</p>\n\n<p>Nick Zapolski hasn’t done every round this year but is usually in the fight for a race podium, and RAW Motorsport team-mate Gavin McAlpine is back this weekend, after missing the previous round at Silverstone.</p>\n\n<p>Alex Spooner and the experienced Mark Williams run with Track Focused too, while the Radical Works Team will be busy fielding James Ockenden, Paul Atherton, James Hadley, and teenage karters Daryl De Leon and Ben Caisley. De Leon and Caisley are karting teammates; the former only made his car racing debut at the last round, and this weekend marks the first time Caisley has even sat in a racing car, creating an exciting footnote in this season’s SR1 Cup action and a preview of what’s to come next year. Privateer Andy Lowe is back also, completing the 16-car line-up.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/398/original/Reduced-DC3_8757.jpg?1631793471 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/398/std/Reduced-DC3_8757.jpg?1631793471\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/398/std/Reduced-DC3_8757.jpg?1631793471\"></p>\n\n<p>The Radical SR1 Cup has both of its 20-minute races on Saturday, at 12.20 and 15.50, with the Radical Challenge racing on Saturday at 14.40 and 18.00, and back on Sunday for the 45-minute Enduro at 14.05.</p>\n\n<p>All of the weekend’s action will live-streamed via the Radical Sportscars’ YouTube channel, with news and updates shared regularly on Instagram and Facebook.</p>"

After a six-year absence from the series, his late call up by RAW Motorsport for the opening round at Snetterton resulted in victory, backed up by a double victory at Brands Hatch GP just a few weeks later. Now back to peak fitness and fresh from a treble victory at the previous round, again at Snetterton, he remains the one to beat.</p>\n\n<p>Jerome de Sadeleer of 360 Racing has been nipping at Bell’s heels all season, and with his double victory at the opening round, remains the only person to have beat Bell all year. A previous multi-race winner, de Sadeleer has had an element of misfortune on several occasions this year and is waiting for an opportunity to pounce. Making his off-road debut, De Sadeleer most recently podiumed in the T4 class at the Rally Raid BAJA SPAIN last month as he prepares for an assault on the famous Dakar Rally, and he will be keen to back up this performance on the track. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Radical Works Team-run Jason Rishover is currently sitting third in the Championship, 41 points behind De Sadeleer. He is still striving for that elusive first win, and with proven pace from his Radical SR3, will be eager to take the top podium step this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>John Macleod has masses of Radical experience and has had his fair share of podiums over the years. Macleod has shown strong consistency and will be right alongside Rishover all weekend. His RAW Motorsport teammate Chris Short has been in podium places a few times, but is the first to admit his excitement. He is still a relative novice to the Radical SR3, having recently graduated from the Radical SR1 Cup.</p>\n\n<p>Peter Tyler is enjoying his season in the new Radical SR3XX, and 360 Racing’s Mark Richards will also be up the front and challenging for victories. Series regular Guillaume Gruchet joins the field under the Newbridge Motorsport flag.</p>\n\n<p>Father and Son duo Rod and Elliot Goodman are both back for RAW after missing the last rounds, and they will be up against teammate Spencer Bourne. Jason Green is out with Scott Sport, while Valour Racing are fielding newly appointed Radical Sportscars UK sales partner Chris Preen, Andrew Greenland, Jacek Zielonka, and Red Bull Sports presenter Mike Chen.</p>\n\n<p>Wesley Fongenie makes a rare appearance for 360 Racing, and Peter Brookes and James Sweetnam are back again with the Radical Works Team.</p>\n\n<p>Fresh from victory in British GT last weekend is Ian Loggie, debuting his new Radical SR3 XX, as is Track Focused’s Dean Warriner, who steps up from the Radical SR1 Cup.</p>\n\n<p>Completing the weekend’s line-up is Mectech’s Anthony Ayres in the Sprint only and Steven Lake and Andrew Goord in the Sprint and Enduro classes.</p>\n\n<p>Radical Challenge races on Saturday at 12.20 and 15.55, and is back for the 45-minute Enduro on Sunday at 13.55.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Radical&nbsp;SR1 Cup</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Radical SR1 Cup is set to be an intense battle between rivals Will Hunt and James Lay. After total dominance in the early legs of the season, Scorpio’s Hunt goes into the Silverstone weekend with a 17-point championship lead over Lay, who is fresh from a double victory at the previous round at Snetterton.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/220/original/2021-UK-R3-SR1-8.jpg?1625735905 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/220/std/2021-UK-R3-SR1-8.jpg?1625735905\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/220/std/2021-UK-R3-SR1-8.jpg?1625735905\"></p>\n\n<p>Hunt had looked unbeatable initially, but the Scorpio driver is now the man under pressure, with RAW Motorsports’ Lay only having only made his car racing debut this year.</p>\n\n<p>A definite one to watch this weekend is Anglo-Filipino karting ace Daryl De Leon Taylor. Having turned 16 less than a fortnight ago, he was out testing his new Radical SR1 the very next day and has already shown the remarkable pace that has seen him through a successful karting career. Will he prove an unlikely challenger to Hunt and Lay?</p>\n\n<p>With championship third-sitter Dean Warriner having graduated to the top-tier Radical Challenge, Track Focused teammate Frazer McFadden should move up to third in the championship. He has two third places under his belt so far, so will be looking to improve.</p>\n\n<p>Top rookie and fifth overall Ben Stone (Track Focused) is still seeking his first podium. Having missed the Snetterton rounds, Nick Zapolski is back for RAW Motorsports, undoubtedly looking to improve on his third place at Brands Hatch GP.</p>\n\n<p>Mackenzie Walker of Road to Race had his best result last time out with a third place, after being sent for an agricultural tour in the previous race.</p>\n\n<p>The ever-smiling Mark Williams (Track Focused) is favourite to win the Fangio Class and will be hot on the young-gun’s heels for a podium finish, with Ian Cowley (TFL Racing) and Andy Lowe looking to get in the mix as well.</p>\n\n<p>Sven Thompson, boss of LMP team Nielsen Racing, is back with the Radical Works Team and will be looking to move up the leader board, as will teammate James Hadley and Track Focused’s Alex Spooner.</p>\n\n<p>Simon Parker and Paul Atherton also debut for the Radical Works Team, while television presenter and YouTuber Drew Stearne joins them in the Radical SR1 as he films a two-part series for popular YouTube channel Carfection Films.</p>\n\n<p>Joining the Radical Challenge on the grid for the first time this year, the Radical SR1 Cup races on Saturday at 12.20 and 15.55, and is back for the 45-minute Enduro on Sunday at 13.55.</p>\n\n<p>Both races can be watched via live stream on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/radicalsportscars\">Radical Sportscars Facebook page</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qogpFbOOcP8\">YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/222/original/2021-UK-R3-SR1.jpg?1625735908 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/222/std/2021-UK-R3-SR1.jpg?1625735908\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/222/std/2021-UK-R3-SR1.jpg?1625735908\"></p>"

The first of two new additions to the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America schedule, the series will join the expanded Trans Am Series in the Pelican State.</p>\n\n<p>For rounds two and three, Radical Cup will support the NTT INDYCAR SERIES in back-to-back events at Barber Motorsports Park in Leeds, Alabama, April 28-30, during the Honda Indy Grand Prix of Alabama and Road America in the beautiful Kettle Moraine region of Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, June 15-18, for the Sonsio Grand Prix presented by AMR. As staples on the series calendar, both events regularly feature over thirty Radical entries.</p>\n\n<p>Still in the works, July’s round is yet to be confirmed but is expected to take place at another high-profile event in the Northeast of the continent.</p>\n\n<p>The series will then head west to the famed Circuit of the Americas (COTA) in Austin, TX over the August 25-27 weekend to join fellow USAC-sanctioned series Porsche Sprint Challenge and the USF Pro Championships ladder program.</p>\n\n<p>Bringing the season to a close, the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America will join the Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey and the NTT INDYCAR SERIES at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca in California, September 8-10 as both series cap off their respective seasons and champions are crowned.</p>\n\n<p>A season finale World Finals event for 2023 is also in the works for November, following the highly successful inaugural Radical World Finals presented by Hankook which this year took place at the picturesque Spring Mountain Motor Resort just West of Las Vegas.</p>\n\n<p>Drewer continued, “With party destinations New Orleans, Austin, and Monterey, and all the excitement of big INDYCAR weekends, I’m not sure what’s going to be more of an attraction– the off-track fun, or the on-track competition.”</p>\n\n<p>Last year saw dramatic growth in the PLATINUM class, with open-wheel stalwart come Radical star Steve Jenks narrowly beating Judd Miller and former ALMS champ Jon Field, while young-guns Palmer Miller and Austin Riley clinched the highly competitive PRO 1500 and PRO 1340 ranks, once again proving the Radical SR3 as the perfect driver development platform.</p>\n\n<p>“With more high-profile events in 2023, the series is again set to attract both rising stars from the country club and premium GT sportscar categories along with young karters and open-wheel drivers looking for an alternative pathway into prototypes and the upper echelons of the sport.”</p>\n\n<p>Licensing via USAC’s radicallicense.com portal and event registration via radicalmotorsport.com will open shortly.</p>\n\n<p>Please stay tuned to the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America social media pages for news and updates as the 2023 season approaches.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2023 Blue Marble Radical Cup North America Schedule</strong></p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:500px;\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>OT</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Jan</td>\n\t\t\t<td>28-29</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>NOLA</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>Official Test</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>R1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Mar</td>\n\t\t\t<td>09-12</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>NOLA</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>Trans Am</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>R2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Apr</td>\n\t\t\t<td>28-30</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Barber</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>IndyCar</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>R3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>June</td>\n\t\t\t<td>15-18</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Road America</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>IndyCar</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>R4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>July</td>\n\t\t\t<td>TBD</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>TBD</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>TBD</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>R5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Aug</td>\n\t\t\t<td>25-27</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>COTA</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>USAC</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>R6</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Sept</td>\n\t\t\t<td>08-10</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Laguna Seca</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>IndyCar</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>WF</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Nov</td>\n\t\t\t<td>TBD</td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>TBD</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td>World Finals</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>For information on press releases or other media services offered by Race Tech Development, please contact Mike Maurini via e-mail at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:Info@RaceTechDevelopment.com\">Info@RaceTechDevelopment.com</a>&nbsp;or 317.270.8723</p>\n\n<p>RTD Media and Management can also be found on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by searching @RTDMediaAndMgmt.</p>"

          "content": "<p>This year’s event plays host to the third round of the Challenge championship and offers an invitational class (non-points scoring) for European Masters drivers. The combined field of SR3 and SR8 sportscars will battle head-to-head around the stunning 4.3-mile circuit over two 40-minute endurance races and a single 20-minute sprint race.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Burgess heads to Spa fresh from clinching a hat-trick of wins around the Brands Hatch Grand Prix circuit. He leads the points having taken five wins from six races so far this year. With a 71-point lead over Dominik Jackson, you’d be forgiven for thinking that Burgess has had it easy. In reality, the 2016 champ has faced some of the stiffest competition in series history, with four strong drivers all fighting for victory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Steve says: “Brands Hatch was a dream and I’m looking for more of the same at Spa. With a maximum success pit stop penalty for race one that could prove a struggle, but I hope to draw from my strong track experience to take another win. The fight is incredibly close, much closer than the points currently indicate, and it’s going to get tougher from here on.\"</p>\n\n<p>Step up Jackson. The most consistent podium finisher in recent years, he twice came agonisingly close to taking a maiden win last time out. He led for the duration in race two, before a penalty for a false start dropped him to third. Running wide whilst leading race three then cost him dear. Regardless, the RAW Motorsports racer is undoubtedly close to victory.</p>\n\n<p>“I’m bored with finishing second!” jokes Jackson. “Consistency is key and heading to Spa I have the benefit of experience. A podium is my minimum expectation. Battling with Steve at Brands, every lap was at qualifying pace, so it’s going to be about who can keep the most consistent pace over the weekend.”</p>\n\n<p>Kristian Jeffrey and Jérôme de Sadeleer will both look to scupper Jackson’s intentions and stem Burgess’ winning streak. Jeffrey leapt from fifth to third in the standings after round two, taking two fourths and a third.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, de Sadeleer endured the most challenging outing of his SR3 campaign having graduated as Champion from the SR1 Cup. Swiss born and half Belgian, de Sadeleer will be hoping to get back on the podium at his home circuit.</p>\n\n<p>He says: “Brands Hatch was a reality check after a confidence boosting win at Donington Park. I head to Spa more humble, intent on building my pace and racecraft to get back on the podium. Spa is one of the most iconic tracks in the world, so to be going into my first home race to face the challenge of mastering Eau Rouge flat out, I’m really excited.”</p>\n\n<p>The midfield fight only seems to intensify between Elliot Goodman, Brands Hatch podium finishers Marcello Marateotto and Brian Caudwell, Mark Crader and Spencer Bourne. There’s some new faces at Spa too, with the likes of Jason Rishover returning to Radical from LMP3 competition.</p>\n\n<p>A clean sweep of round two class wins has helped Peter Tyler and Tom Gladdis jump from third to lead the Team Challenge by 20 points from John Caudwell and Stuart Moseley. Adrian and Joe Watt return to the category whilst newcomers Ted Murray and Dan Crossley join with UPE Motorsport.</p>\n\n<p>In the invitational SR8 class, American duo Jim and Ryan Booth will pair up across the pond. They’ll be running head-to head with the likes of Andrew and Jeremy Ferguson, plus Jamie Constable and Jonathan Kennard.</p>\n\n<p>The 2018 Radical Festival begins with qualifying at 09.00 (local time) on Saturday, followed by the first 40-minute race of the weekend at 13.00. The action continues on Sunday with the 20-minute sprint race at 10.30, ahead of the final endurance showdown at 16.15.</p>\n\n<p>Radical race fans can follow all the action live on the new and improved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/RadicalSportscarsUK\" target=\"_blank\">Radical TV YouTube</a> channel throughout the weekend.

          "content": "<p>Radical Sportscars today celebrates its 25th year in business, entering the milestone anniversary in a period of unprecedented health and growth as total production approaches 2,500 cars. To mark the occasion, the Company has appointed Charley Hoyt as official Radical Company Historian. Charley has dedicated an incredible amount of his time documenting the history of the Company, as well as building a registry of Radical cars produced to-date.</p>\n\n<p>Development and production of the first car, the Radical 1100 Clubsport, was started by Phil Abbott in 1996. Joined by Mick Hyde, the pair formally incorporated Radical Sportscars as a company on 28 January 1997 to produce their Kawasaki-powered sports prototype racing car. The 1100 Clubsport’s public debut was at Brands Hatch circuit in April 1997.</p>\n\n<p>With a superbike engine inside a small and lightweight open-cockpit steel tube chassis and the first use of a bespoke powertrain system for a superbike-powered sports racer, the innovative Radical 1100 Clubsport was designed to compete in the 750 Motor Club’s Sports 2000 category. By 1999 there were enough 1100 Clubsports to fill an entire grid, and Radical Challenge racing as we know it today began.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/545/original/Rad-Jan25-Clubsport-2.jpg?1643386925 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/545/std/Rad-Jan25-Clubsport-2.jpg?1643386925\" width=\"500\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/545/std/Rad-Jan25-Clubsport-2.jpg?1643386925\"></p>\n\n<p>The Radical 1100 Clubsport pioneered a formula that would go on to see Radical Sportscars become the world’s most popular manufacturer of sports prototype racing cars, and evolve into a company that is now second only to Porsche Motorsport, by volume, as the largest manufacturer of race cars in the world.</p>\n\n<p>There have been many milestones checked along the way, most notably the launch of the iconic Radical SR3 in 2001, the car that would solidify Radical’s place in British motorsport history and secure the fledgling company’s future. The awesome RPE 2.6-litre V8-powered Radical SR8 was added to the range in 2005, there was a run of appearances in the LMP2 class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans from 2006, and a 6m48s production car lap record at the Nürburgring came in 2009. The fully type-approved, street legal Radical SR3 SL was unleashed in 2011, and the flagship EcoBoost-powered twin-turbo V6 Radical RXC arrived in 2013, itself becoming homologated for road use in 2015. Radical built its 2,000th car in 2017, and in 2020 launched the Radical SR10, which would go on to become the fastest-selling model in Radical’s history.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/498/original/Rad-2021-12-Portimao-15.jpg?1639576316 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/498/std/Rad-2021-12-Portimao-15.jpg?1639576316\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/498/std/Rad-2021-12-Portimao-15.jpg?1639576316\"></p>\n\n<p>Radical holds a unique place in the hearts and minds of racing and track day enthusiasts the world over, and in the early 2000s the Cambridgeshire-made cars began to find an increasingly popular home on the racetracks of the United States. Today, some 90 percent of production is exported, predominantly to the United States, which is yet another incredible tale of traditional British motorsport know-how finding success on a global stage.</p>\n\n<p>Radical plans to celebrate its Silver Jubilee anniversary with a series of events and activations throughout 2022 to mark the milestone.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these is the appointment of Charley Hoyt as the company’s first ever Official Historian, a title given to recognise the fact that while not a Radical employee, Charley’s passion for the brand and his work in building a network of Radical owners embodies the very spirit that has made the brand so iconic.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/544/original/Rad-Jan25-Hoyt-2.jpg?1643386923 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/544/std/Rad-Jan25-Hoyt-2.jpg?1643386923\" width=\"500\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/544/std/Rad-Jan25-Hoyt-2.jpg?1643386923\"></p>\n\n<p>Through his website, the Radical Sportscar Registry, Charley tracks chassis numbers and build details of Radical cars to preserve the history, and runs a forum which has become a thriving hub for Radical enthusiasts, building the community off the track. Based from his home in Southern California, Charley will be working with Radical throughout its anniversary year across the Atlantic to bring this history out of the archives.</p>\n\n<p>Charley is excited about his new role, and is looking forward to building the Radical community further by contributing to a series of 25th anniversary events.</p>\n\n<p>“One of the primary goals of the Radical Sportscar Registry is to preserve the history of Radicals and to build a worldwide community to share information about them. One of my favourite parts of Radical ownership is all of the friends I meet at the track, and to be able to foster that off the track and to expand it to a worldwide community is incredible. I’m regularly communicating with Radical owners on every continent (except for Antarctica!) and look forward to helping tell the Radical story in its 25th year.”</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/547/original/Rad-Jan25-Hoyt.jpg?1643386928 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/547/std/Rad-Jan25-Hoyt.jpg?1643386928\" width=\"500\" height=\"361\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/547/std/Rad-Jan25-Hoyt.jpg?1643386928\"></p>\n\n<p>Joe Anwyll, CEO, echoed Charley’s comments.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve been aware for some time of the excellent work that Charley has been doing in documenting our history and building the community that we all love so much, and welcoming him as our historian on our birthday is a fitting way to kick off our 25th year.</p>\n\n<p>“Radical has always considered itself a modern and young company, and we tend to look forward rather than backward. But time flies and our earlier cars are rapidly becoming historics, with some of the first Clubsports and SR3s already under restoration to their original specification.</p>\n\n<p>“As we reach this milestone it is good to take a moment to look back and see where we’ve come from. Charley’s depth of knowledge is second-to-none, and his passion for Radical runs deep. We’re thrilled to share our 25th year with him in such a way.”</p>\n\n<p>Radical has enjoyed unprecedented growth as it heads into its 25th year, building and selling more cars in 2021 than at any other time in its history. The Radical SR3 XX and SR10 benefit from a suite of updates, and after its first full year of production the Radical SR10 has become the fastest-selling car in Radical’s history, with over 100 examples already sold. A 32-strong global dealer network spanning 21 countries underpins this growth, and there are now 12 factory-supported Radical racing championships across four different continents, including the Radical Challenge UK and the Radical Cup North America.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/543/original/Rad-Jan25-Clubsport.jpg?1643386923 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/543/std/Rad-Jan25-Clubsport.jpg?1643386923\" width=\"500\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/543/std/Rad-Jan25-Clubsport.jpg?1643386923\"></p>"

With the exception of Oulton Park, all events take place over two days with an early Sunday finish for the busy competitor to make the most of their weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Carly Latcham, Championship Coordinator, said: “With consistently strong grids across the 2019 season, and a multitude of new teams and drivers joining the series, we have a great competitor base to spring into 2020. We’ve been careful to ensure that the format, calendar and package elements that made this year such a success continue. In particular we’ve paid close attention to the varied and busy race schedules of our teams and drivers – many of whom participate in multiple series – to ensure clashes are kept to a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>“The reinvigoration of the Team Challenge class has been a real pleasure to see, with four new pairings joining the field, and we’re working hard behind the scenes to ensure next year’s regulations continue to grow this class alongside the hotly-contested Solo category.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provisional 2020 Radical Challenge Calendar</strong><br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;18-19 April: Donington Park National<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;02-03 May: Brands Hatch Grand Prix<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;16-17 May: Snetterton 300<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20 June: Oulton Park International<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;15-16 August: Silverstone Grand Prix<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;12-13 September: Donington Park Grand Prix<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;02-04 October: Spa-Francorchamps Radical Festival*</p>\n\n<p>*Includes invitational class for SR1 and other models</p>\n\n<p>Note: All dates are provisional and subject to change by the ASN/FIA until 2020 Radical Challenge Sporting &amp; Technical Regulations are published</p>"

          "content": "<p>Ultimately no one - not even returning RAC champion Peter Paddon - could stop SuperSports points leader Mitch Neilson from a trio of wins to all but put the state series championship out of contention ahead of the season finale in November.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the colours of Spring in the surrounding region, the nearby snowfields were continuing to experience solid falls on the ski slopes, making ambient conditions at Wakefield particularly chilly, something which was making extracting tyre temperature a challenge for many of the teams, especially with qualifying scheduled for first thing Saturday morning.</p>\n\n<p>Typically the faster Class 2 cars claimed the front row of the grid for the first of the 14-lap races, but Mitch Neilson showed impressive pace just a quarter of a second slower than Alex Kenny who would go on to win all three races outright, Neilson’s pace so good that he was half a second faster than three-time RAC champion Peter Paddon who was returning after a six month sabbatical.</p>\n\n<p>The action started early in the opening race with Greg Kenny turned around on the formation lap, forcing the starter to abort their first effort and Kenny to start from rear of field.</p>\n\n<p>Once the green was given the action continued at turn one with Paddon turning around the ‘First Focus’ entry after putting two wheels on the grass on the run into the corner chasing Neilson. That left Neilson clear in the Class 1 lead with the impressive Peter Clare second but in a tight battle with Chris Sutton, John Beck, Chris Perini and Peter Hills who once more was charging through the field from the back in the SR8.</p>\n\n<p>Clare held on brilliantly until lap nine when Sutton and Perini were able to take advantage of a gap and drop the ‘Shared Runway’ driver back to fourth, Hills following through the next lap to take sixth at the line, Clare though hanging on for fourth in Class behind Neilson, Sutton and Perini. It wasn’t all bad news for Peter Paddon, the reigning RAC champion setting the fastest lap of the race for the Class 1 field three laps from home as he caught and passed Paul Braico ahead of the flag for seventh.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Sutton was the big mover early in race two, charging past Neilson into turn one as Stephen Champion spun as he battled further back in the pack. A Safety Car intervention then allowed the field to tighten ahead of the restart which allowed the charging Peter Paddon up onto the tail of Neilson, Neilson though focussed on regaining the lead as they were given the green.</p>\n\n<p>Sutton protected but ultimately couldn’t stop Neilson from moving back to the top spot in the final corner, the points leader extending his advantage across the remainder of the race as behind him, Sutton battled Paddon, Perini and John Beck through the middle of the race.</p>\n\n<p>Paddon was ultimately able to get past Sutton on the main straight, but try as he might he couldn’t breach the gap to Neilson who crossed the line five seconds clear. Behind them though things were starting to get interesting..</p>\n\n<p>Chris Sutton’s great run sadly ended coming out of turn two with four to go whilst still holding third, whilst Perini came off the track at the ‘Fish Hook’ filling the car with mud and water from the outfield, which ultimately contributed to a spin with two laps to go whilst he was third.</p>\n\n<p>That handed the returning John Beck the final podium position behind Neilson and Paddon with Peter Clare locked under his rear win. Paul Braico was fifth from Greg Kenny whose consistency maintained his second placing in the Class 1 points, whilst Perini recovered to cross the line seventh ahead of Champion.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately the final race was relatively pedestrian in comparison to the two earlier races, the two Class 2 cars claiming a 1-2 finish, whilst Mitch Neilson claimed his third win of the weekend after weathering an attack from Paddon at turn one on the opening lap, from there he was able to pull away to another five second win. Peter Clare impressively crossed the line just two seconds behind the three-time RAC title holder and six seconds up on John Beck, Chris Perini fifth ahead of Paul Braico, Greg Kenny and Stephen Champion.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of another strong weekend, Mitch Neilson has all but sealed the 2018 SuperSports Class 1 title heading to the season finale at Sydney Motorsport Park on November 17, his consistency so good that he’s also jumped into the SuperSports outright points lead with just three races remaining.</p>\n\n<p>For the Radical Australia Cup regulars, they will return to action in less than two weeks for the final round of the 2018 season, at Sydney Motorsport Park (21-23 September).</p>"

In comparison, the iconic SR8 model took four years to reach the same milestone.</p>\n\n<p>With final developments taking place during the 2020 lockdown and officially launching in September 2020, with the first production model completing build in December 2020, SR10 has proven popular with Radical Sportscars’ global customer base due to its brand-new formula, based on a proven background of developing and manufacturing high-downforce racing cars since 1997.</p>\n\n<p>Constructed and engineered at its UK HQ, the SR10 is powered by Radical Performance Engines’ (RPE) developed Ford EcoBoost 2.3-litre turbocharged engine. Arriving as a crate, the in-house RPE team strips it to its core components, machines and strengthens the block ready for its forged internals, dry sump, larger, custom-built Garrett turbo and its own exhaust manifold. Each RPE-Ford engine is then dyno tested to verify the engine build and its bespoke mapping, before being installed in to the SR10 chassis.</p>\n\n<p>The result is over 425 bhp and 380Ib-ft of torque on tap, with the custom Garrett G-Series turbocharger delivering drivers a better throttle response and reduced lag. The RPE-Ford engine unit was developed to be a high output, long-life powertrain to help keep running costs for customers low, with lower maintenance intervals than its competitors. To increase durability and performance, Radical Sportscars turned to transmission and transaxle specialists Hewland for its GT3-derived six-speed gearbox and Hewland TMT-200 transaxle, the latter originally developed for the FIA F2 single-seater.</p>\n\n<p>Designed to keep drivers on track for longer and at faster speeds, the SR10 has a top speed of 180 mph and accelerates from 0-60 mph in 2.4 seconds, allowing racers to out-run and out-manoeuvre the competition. With its digital dash and full data logging capabilities, including video and telemetry, the SR10 is able to assist both drivers and driver coaches in giving the best data to help get them the win. A clear example of this can be found in the Radical Cup in North America, where the SR10 has dominated the series, winning every round so far, which comes as no surprise with its overall power to weight ratio of 586 bhp per tonne and peak lateral force of 2.3 g. With over 31 dealers worldwide, and eligible for use globally, it’s been the American market and in particular Radical Sportscars’ Californian dealer, Radical Northwest who is among the top-performing dealers globally.</p>\n\n<p>Dan Redpath, Global Sales Director said: “Since the launch of the SR10, we have been delighted with the number of orders from both existing and new-to-brand customers. It is fantastic news for the entire team at Radical - who worked non-stop to develop our best race car - to see the results of their hard work. To have 50 SR10s built so far with plenty more orders in the book, is incredibly encouraging for the company. On top of that, to see the car consistently win in our Radical Cup in North America highlights all the engineering developments our in-house team has done over the past 18 months.”</p>\n\n<p>Steve Cameron, Radical Northwest dealer co-owner and two-times Daytona 24hr class winner commented: “It has been an incredible first year for the SR10, the performance of the car is unparalleled and it’s not just something I’ve noticed as a racer, but so have our customers as well. It is the most competitive Radical out there at the moment and has shown that time after time, particularly in the Radical Cup we have over on this side of the Atlantic. Both the teams and Radical drivers over here are just so thankful that we are back racing once again safely, thanks to the new COVID measures. The season is not over just yet, but we have already seen an increase in interest from those who have seen it on track. 2022 looks very strong.”</p>\n\n<p>The British manufacturer, who will be celebrating its 25-year anniversary in 2022, has seen an overwhelming number of orders across a range of its models this year, and is on track to deliver a record number of cars in 2021. It continues to develop, design, engineer, manufacture and organise race series for all its models from its headquarters in Peterborough, UK, from where the vehicles are exported all over the world.</p>\n\n<p>To follow along with its worldwide racing calendar, please visit: <a href=\"http://www.radicalsportscars.com/events\">www.radicalsportscars.com/events</a>.

          "content": "<p>After the opening salvo one week previous at Road Atlanta, the field ‘virtually’ crossed the Atlantic for the closest round of the series to Radical’s Peterborough HQ. A truly diverse field of eleven different nationalities, all competing in the original, visceral SR8 Supersport.</p>\n\n<p>UK-based iRacer Dan Webster commanded a lights-to-flag victory, after scooping a 1:54.6 pole lap, a superb time both virtually and in the real-world. Alongside him on the front row was Road Atlanta victor Zachary Woollen and both were challenged by Canadian single-seater ace Alex Ellis throughout the race. Indy Lights racer and Turn3 team principal Peter Dempsey qualified fourth but a spin on the&nbsp;fourth lap dropped the Irishman out of contention, promoting multiple Radical champion Bradley Smith to fourth. Smith in turn had a spin but was able to retake the place from Dempsey in the latter stages of the race.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in the top ten, there was a close four-way scrap between Radical’s real-world racers. Blue Marble Cocktails Cup North America competitor Jordan Missig, SRT3 trackdayer Jay Kullar, 2019 SR1 Cup Rookie champion Mark Tranter and Radical Challenge vice-champion Jerome de Sadeleer battled for position throughout the race, broadcast live on https://www.radicalsportscars.com/ and on Radical TV, Radical’s YouTube channel. You can review all the action from the race again in the video below.<br>\nThere’s now a two-week break before action recommences, drivers clocking up the virtual air miles as the series returns back across the Atlantic to Canadian Tire Motorsports Park, better known as Mosport. Join us at 15:00 GMT / 16:00 BST / 11:00 EDT on Saturday 16th May for Round 3 !Pre-qualifying for the ‘all-comers’ element of the grid commences on Friday.

The Radical SR3 XX and SR10 benefit from a suite of updates for 2022, and after its first full year of production, the Radical SR10 has become the fastest-selling car in Radical’s history, with over 100 examples already sold. A 33-strong global dealer network spanning 21 countries underpins this growth, and there are now 14 factory-supported Radical racing championships across four different continents, including the Radical Challenge UK and the Radical Cup North America.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Radical Motorsport is one of the world’s most prolific sportscar manufacturers, with over 2,800 cars produced in the past 25 years. From its 1997 inception, Radical set out to create a customer-lead niche in the world of motorsport, a race-bred thrill-a-minute driving experience on the racetrack and road.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A combination of lightweight construction, superbike derived technology and aerodynamic downforce delivers models faster than a super car, totally driver-focussed and rewarding to drive. Entering its third decade, the Radical stable includes the SR1, the most successful prototype-style sports racing car in the world – the SR3 XX, the record-breaking 405bhp SR8, road-specification Rapture, the RXC Spyder, RXC 600R, RXC GT3. The turbocharged SR10 was launched early 2021 and headlines Radical’s SR product range with over 425bhp and 380lb-ft of torque for blistering performance. All models from the renowned racing car manufacturer are solely designed, engineered and built at Radical’s Cambridgeshire headquarters, by 70 of the company’s 130-strong staff.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Radical was the first manufacturer to bring long-format, double-header endurance racing to club level motorsport competition while providing comprehensive spares and technical support. The marque’s official single-make championships offer the ultimate driving experience and progressive racing ladder for prototype-style sportscar racing for drivers of all abilities, while Radical’s ‘Race the World’ mission offers an end-to-end racing, training and support network across the globe.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>CONTACT:</h3>\n\n<p>Holly Webb</p>\n\n<p>Digital Marketing Coordinator</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:holly.webb@radicalmotorsport.com\">holly.webb@radicalmotorsport.com</a></p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/RadicalMotorsport\">WATCH LIVE</a>"

          "content": "<p>Significant accidents have taken place in high profile race formulae across the globe in recent times, and in order to maintain an impeccable customer safety record Radical’s Engineering department was tasked with investigating additional safety in the form of an optional top mounted safety structure.</p>\n\n<p>The Cockpit Safety Structure has been developed with the principle purpose of improving occupant safety, and its design also minimises aerodynamic drag whilst maintaining Radical Motorsport’s world-renowned chassis handling attributes.&nbsp; Constructed from T45 high strength stainless steel alloy, the structure also maximises strength with minimal weight increase.</p>\n\n<p>Dan Redpath, Group Sales and Marketing Director said:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“We have taken inspiration from the technology in motorsport which we’ve seen work so effectively and appropriated it to SR3 XX and SR10. Putting the safety of our customers first has always been our priority, and as the UK’s largest race car manufacturer we are delighted to be able to offer this option without compromising our core DNA of delivering an exhilarating motorsport experience.”</p>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport Development Driver, James Pinkerton, commented:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">“It’s great to witness the continuous development of these cars, whether it’s performance gains or in this case, improving driver safety. After just a few laps it fades into the background and becomes invisible to the driver.”</p>\n\n<p>The Cockpit Safety Structure is available to all markets, on left hand drive, centre hand drive and right hand drive variants of SR3 XX and SR10.</p>\n\n<p>For new SR3s and SR10s produced from July 2022 onwards, the Cockpit Safety Structure can be retrofitted should it not have been specified at the point of build. A fitting kit including bracketry and instructions will be provided with the purchase of the unit, available shortly via authorised Radical Motorsport dealers; the possibility of retrofitting to older, pre-July 2022 cars is currently being investigated.</p>\n\n<p>The new 2022 SR3 XX and SR10 models are available to order via 33 dealer partners in 21 countries, and eligible for use globally. The opportunities to race continue to expand, with the addition of the Radical Cup Philippines launching in 2022 alongside 12 other race series across four continents providing Radical owners the ability to truly ‘Race the World’.</p>\n\n\n\n    <p><a class=\"button button--revealer\" data-panel-reveal=\"reveal-panel-1706\" data-reveal-label=\"Read More\" data-hide-label=\"Hide It\">Read More</a></p>\n    <div id=\"reveal-panel-1706\" data-reveal-copy=\"\">\n      <p><strong>NOTES TO EDITORS</strong></p>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport has enjoyed unprecedented growth as it heads into its 25th year, building and selling more cars in 2021 than at any other time in its history. The Radical SR3 XX and SR10 benefit from a suite of updates for 2022, and after its first full year of production the Radical SR10 has become the fastest-selling car in Radical’s history, with over 100 examples already sold. A 33-strong global dealer network spanning 21 countries underpins this growth, and there are now 13 factory-supported Radical racing championships across four different continents, including the Radical Challenge UK and the Radical Cup North America.</p>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport is one of the world’s most prolific sportscar manufacturers, with over 2,800 cars produced in the past 25 years. From its 1997 inception, Radical set out to create a customer-lead niche in the world of motorsport, a race-bred thrill-a-minute driving experience on the racetrack and road.</p>\n\n<p>A combination of lightweight construction, superbike derived technology and aerodynamic downforce delivers models faster than a super car, totally driver-focussed and rewarding to drive. Entering its third decade, the Radical stable includes the 182bhp SR1, the most successful prototype-style sports racing car in the world – the 225bhp SR3 XX, the record-breaking 405bhp SR8, road-legal Rapture, the RXC Spyder, RXC 600R, RXC GT3. The turbocharged SR10 was launched midway through 2020 and headlines Radical’s SR product range with over 425bhp and 380lb-ft of torque for blistering performance. All models from the renowned racing car manufacturer are solely designed, engineered and built at Radical’s Cambridgeshire headquarters, by 70 of the company’s 130-strong staff.</p>\n\n<p>Radical was the first manufacturer to bring long-format, double-header endurance racing to club level motorsport competition while providing comprehensive spares and technical support. The marque’s official single-make championships offer the ultimate driving experience and progressive racing ladder for prototype-style sportscar racing for drivers of all abilities, while Radical’s ‘Race the World’ mission offers an end-to-end racing, training and support network across the globe.</p>\n\n<p>For further information visit www.radicalmotorsport.com or contact:</p>\n\n<p>Jon Roach</p>\n\n<p>Global Head of Marketing</p>\n\n<p>jon.roach@radicalmotorsport.com</p>\n\n<p>+44 (0)7887 836499</p>\n\n    </div>"

Whilst keeping its proven five-year format of unrivalled track time, expert tuition and dedicated event support, the traditionally novice-only class is now open to all senior MSA licence holders. Add to that the arrival of the newly re-styled 175bhp high-downforce, lightweight RPE-Suzuki powered second generation SR1, an expanded six-round programme and unrivalled competition packages, grid sizes are set to soar in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from the SR1 Cup, drivers can climb the ranks to the Radical Challenge with the 225bhp SR3, the world’s best-selling racecar with over 1,100 in market, through to European-wide competition with the 405bhp SR8 and Radical Euro Masters Championship.</p>\n\n<p>Registrations are open and provisional 2018 calendar available across Radical’s championship portfolio. Drop by the stand to find out more about the wide range of highly-competitive competition packages. Each include dedicated driver development, testing and event support, to suit novice racers, karting graduates and experienced drivers alike.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of karting graduates, Radical will be staging a special Karters Meet &amp; Greet on-stand throughout Saturday. The first-time initiative will give karters looking to make the switch to sportscars the opportunity to get expert technical and driver development advice and sign up to an exclusive taster test day, driving the new Generation 2 SRI. Just visit stand 2670 for further details.</p>\n\n<p>Autosport International 2018 will mark the first official engagement for SR1 Cup Shootout winner Ryan Harper-Ellam, a former multiple Junior TKM race winner. Ryan will share his roller-coaster experience to winning the inaugural Shootout competition on the Autosport Stage on Friday, as he looks ahead to his maiden season as a fully-funded Works Team driver. He’ll also be on the Radical stand to chat with aspiring sportscar racers across all four days.</p>\n\n<p>Radical will also support TalkShop at Autosport International for the first time in January. James Pinkerton, Radical Engine Development Manager, will be talking about the evolution of Radical’s range of powertrain solutions, from motorcycle-derived beginnings through to the development of Radical’s own RP-V8 and on to modern, turbocharged EcoBoost engines. The 30-minute presentation, entitled ‘Technology in cost-effective prototype sportcar racing’ will take place on stand 8020 at 12pm on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>“Autosport International is the ideal platform for Radical to present its 2018 international racing calendars in our 21st&nbsp;year of trading,” said the company’s Sales &amp; Marketing Director, Nigel Land. “In 2018, we will continue the success of the SR1 Cup Shootout, as a development programme for new and existing racers to enter the exciting world of prototype sportscar racing. Look out for announcements on the first of a number of new, global partnerships that will enhance the racing and trackday ownership experience for our drivers too.”</p>\n\n<p>For further Autosport International show and ticket information visit <a href=\"http://www.autosport-international.com\">www.autosport-international.com</a></p>"

Contact while Eric Wagner was behind the wheel forced the car behind the wall for a quick alignment, but a bigger blow came shortly after when the custom electrical generator the team was running failed and had to be replaced, taking the #10 out of commission for almost 90 minutes. They then mounted a remarkable comeback, led by Dempsey and Franzoni who drove at qualifying pace. From running as low as 34th they clawed their way to back into the top five.</p>\n\n<p>The #44 CrowdStrike/One Motorsports SR3 of George Kurtz, Gerhard Watzinger, Jeff Shafer and Kenton Koch finished third in class, and seventeenth outright. They were unlucky not to win the event after effectively dominating the 16th running of the longest automobile race in the United States, leading the race for 16 out of the 25 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the night Koch seemed to be in a league of his own, as he completed long stints in the #44. The onboard footage from the team’s livestream was mesmerising, as he carved his way around the backmarkers.</p>\n\n<p>The car survived a right-rear puncture and an altercation with a BMW prior to the sixth hour. Before the eighth hour the clutch was bled, which appeared to be precautionary but in reality hinted at what would come. The car avoided another scare in the ninth hour when a wheel was damaged whilst Shafer was driving, and even swapping out the paddleshift compressor couldn’t remove #44 from the lead.</p>\n\n<p>At the halfway point it looked as though luck had swung in #44’s favour when the Norma fell out of contention and the Porsche of Le Mans veterans, Flying Lizard Motorsports required a driveshaft. However, just after 7am and with only five hours remaining that luck ran out.</p>\n\n<p>“We had a clutch problem from the beginning, and the clutch eventually failed. Debris got in and messed up the crank sensor and shut the engine off,” <strong>Shafer</strong> explained. “We were going to change it, but there was only two hours left in the race and we weren’t going to change position.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>George Kurtz </strong>(2018 was his sixth try at outright victory) added, “This was our best attempt yet. We gave it everything. Thunderhill is always a heartbreak. We led more laps than any other car but that doesn’t count - if only it were the 20 Hours of Thunderhill.”</p>\n\n<p>All eyes then turned to the #67 Radical, which had been running a relatively quiet and uneventful race with a driver line-up of a combined age of 243. As the race-clock struck twelve, the car pitted with a misfire caused by a battered sensor which was promptly removed. The only other drama came an hour later when the #67 suffered a right-rear puncture.</p>\n\n<p>With just three hours left to run, and lying just a lap and a half behind the #74 Flying Lizard Motorsports Porsche, the #67 refuelled for the final time, electing to keep Mikel Miller behind the wheel. What ensued was effectively a hare-and-tortoise race.</p>\n\n<p>With Miller at the helm for the final stint of 4 hours and 25 minutes, #67 came tantalizingly close to outright victory, in the end finishing just three laps behind the race winning #74 Porsche.</p>\n\n<p>“While we didn’t have the outright pace of the other two Radical teams, we just ran our own race,” commented <strong>Lahaye.</strong> “Sometimes you make your own luck.”</p>\n\n<p>Radical drivers and teams are already planning next year’s assault. <strong>George Kurtz</strong> added, ‘We’ll be back next year.”</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/our-cars/sr3\">FIND OUT ABOUT THE SR3</a>"

          "content": "<p>Established in 2015, Arise Racing is a professional racing team in Western Australia (WA), offering a complete range of motorsport services in state-of-the-art facilities at Wanneroo Raceway near Perth. Arise Racing specialise in three distinct categories being Racing, Driver Development and Special Events.</p>\n\n<p>Arise Racing is dedicated to delivering a premium product on every level, and as such tailors each product to meet the client’s individual requirements. Arise Racing delivers its Customer Racing packages and race options in their own fleet of Radical SR3s and can also offer a complete sales and support package to prospective and current Radical owners in WA as well.</p>\n\n<p>“Arise Racing is excited to start this new chapter with Radical Sportscars. Having a Radical representative based on the West Coast will not only help to grow the series locally, but also offer a pathway for Western Australians to compete on a National stage,” <strong>said Jordan Oon, General Manager at Arise Racing</strong>. “With the ability to offer trackside support covering both technical and driver coaching aspects, our goal is to introduce new and talented drivers to the Radical family, and grow the Western Australian series to the point where it can support its own stand alone, one-make category. From here we plan to build a National Radical Australia Cup contingent from the West, aiming to support and grow Radical as a premier racing category around the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Arise is also focused on building a strong link with the Radical UK factory, and utilising our already strong relationship with Edith Cowan University Motorsports, offering graduate motorsport engineers the opportunity to further their international careers and vice versa.”</p>\n\n<p>“Radical has been associated with exhilarating racing competition in Australia for over a decade, and now with the appointment of Arise Racing we are able to extend our network and support to racers in Western Australia with a closer, more tailored approach,” commented <strong>Dan Redpath, Global Sales Director at Radical Sportscars</strong>.&nbsp;“We understand that the geographic scale of Australia can make the commitment of driving on-track challenging, so with Arise Racing based at Wanneroo Raceway and supported by their detailed technical and driver support options, Radical racers have a close and convenient service partner.”</p>\n\n<p>Arise Racing’s first consignment of SR3 RSX have just landed in Australia, perfect for trackday use and competition in the Radical Australia Cup and other regional events. A dedicated Radical portal for WA will launch imminently.

          "content": "<p><strong>March 10, 2023</strong> – Female racing star and American racing driver, twenty-four-year-old Aurora Straus has been named an official ambassador for global racing car manufacturer Radical Motorsport. The news coincides with confirmation of her return to the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America for the 2023 season. After becoming the first woman to enter the series, and win a race, in 2022, Straus will be piloting the #17 Richard Mille Radical SR3 in the Pro 1500 class.</p>\n\n<p>After scoring three podiums including two second-place finishes in her debut at Watkins Glen, Straus went on to finish third at the Circuit of the Americas before adding a pair of race wins and a third-place finish in last year’s Sonoma Raceway season finale. Her results propelled Group-A Racing to the Team Championship title in the Pro 1500 ranks in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>“We are thrilled to have Aurora back in the Blue Marble Radical Cup as a competitor and an ambassador for Radical Motorsport,” explained Tom Drewer, Global Motorsport Director. “Aurora is a proven talent, recently taking a top 6 finish at Daytona. We look forward to seeing her push the Radical brand to a higher level.”</p>\n\n<p>Graduating from Harvard and an experienced sports car racer, Aurora started her racing career in spec Mazda MX-5 cars in 2015 and then progressed into the 2016 Continental Tire Sportscar Challenge. Moving to the Pirelli World Challenge Sprint-X series in 2018, in a BMW M4 GT4 operated by ST Racing Aurora claimed two victories and four podiums.

          "content": "<p>One of the biggest UK Radical grids in five years made the trip across the Channel for the Radical Festival last month and Silverstone will be no different, with another bumper grid of over 30 cars already confirmed for battle around the 3.66-mile Grand Prix circuit.</p>\n\n<p>Four different winners in six rounds proves the class of the 2017 field. The opening-season Donington Park spoils went to Bradley Smith and reigning Radical Challenge Champion Steve Burgess, while Jack Lang, Oliver Barker and Burgess took a class win apiece at Spa.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to his consistently high points-scoring finishes and an outstanding run, bagging first, second and third in class at Spa, Lang leads the provisional title table heading into the third stage rounds. Pole sitter, race two victor and triple podium finisher at Silverstone last year, the Gorse Motors charge must be counted among the favourites for this year’s showdown.</p>\n\n<p>Despite a frustrating first race at Spa, in which Burgess salvaged seventh place after getting caught up in a blocked pitlane, the RAW Motorsport driver sits second, just nine points adrift. With two wins and a brace of third-place podiums already to his credit, Burgess will be aiming to continue his winning form around the challenging Northamptonshire circuit.</p>\n\n<p>Lying third after stepping up from the SR1 Cup this season, Barker is already impressing in his debut Radical Challenge season, not least with three pole positions and three fastest laps adding to his outright win, second and fourth place finishes in Belgium. Completing the current top six, Dominik Jackson, Shahin Nouri and Mark Richards are all certain to feature at the front of the field, while race one winner at Silverstone 2016, Jack Manchester should also be counted among the potential favourites.</p>\n\n<p>The battle for the Team Challenge spoils is also hotting up, as father and son duo Brian and Tom Harvey – race three Team winners at Silverstone last year – lead the title table after the first six rounds. Paul Allen and Jason Redding, the pairing that secured class pole in second qualifying at Silverstone 2016, currently sit second.</p>\n\n<p>Also not to be discounted this weekend will be Pete Tyler and Tom Gladdis. Currently eighth in the Team standings after a challenging time at Spa, the experienced duo boast a strong track record at Silverstone having taken two class wins there last year.</p>\n\n<p>Supporting the popular ‘MG Live’ weekend at Silverstone, the Radical Challenge action kicks off with qualifying at 11:20 on Saturday 17th June, followed by the first of two 20-minute races at 15:55. Racing resumes on Sunday with race two at 10:25, while the third and final 40-minute feature race is scheduled for 15:55.</p>"

          "content": "<p>Barker meant business from Saturday morning qualifying, coming out on top of a two-way fight for the top spot with closest championship rival Steve Burgess to take his first Radical Challenge pole position by 0.433.</p>\n\n<p>As lap times tumbled on the drying track following early morning rain showers, Dominik Jackson took third fastest by just 0.010 from SR1 Cup graduate Richard Baxter. Jack Manchester clocked in fifth fastest ahead of a season best performance from Brian Murphy for sixth. Peter Tyler and Paul Gladdis set the Team Challenge pole position time, 11th overall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 1 / Round 13</strong></p>\n\n<p>Barker turned his maiden SR3 pole position into lights-to-flag victory in the first 20-minute race of the weekend, but the Nielsen Racing driver didn’t have it all his own way with Burgess piling on the pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Despite a superb start from both front-row drivers, Barker won the charge into Riches, leaving Burgess to slot into second. Manchester charged through from fifth before going off-track, leaving Jackson and Baxter to retain their starting order in third and fourth respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Recovering from time lost in qualifying due to an air jack issue while pitting for tyres, current championship leader Jack Lang was the man on the move, charging from ninth to fourth in three laps. A mechanical issue in the latter stages, however, meant the 360 Racing charge had to settle for ninth.</p>\n\n<p>Back at the front, Burgess refused to give Barker any breathing space and punched in a flying lap to close within 0.266 seconds approaching half distance. But a run wide following an unsuccessful pass at the hairpin lost vital time while Barker posted consecutive fastest laps to pull out a decisive lead.</p>\n\n<p>Bar Baxter taking Lang on the penultimate tour for fourth, the order remained unchanged with Barker bagging vital points over Burgess and Jackson completing the podium. After a thrilling race-long battle, Elliot Goodman and Jason Rishover completed the top six. Tyler took the Team Challenge spoils, 13th overall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 2 / Round 14</strong></p>\n\n<p>Barker served up more of the same for race two, once again leading Burgess from the lights, but it was Manchester that nailed the start to soar from sixth to third. Jackson slotted into fourth ahead of Mark Richards, triggering a race-long battle which would see the pair swap places throughout, with Sean Byrne sixth.</p>\n\n<p>Barker pushed to build a seven-second buffer until Burgess span out of contention and the race at Murrays five laps in, offering some small reprieve to current title leader Lang, who was enduring a challenging weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Clear of the resulting safety car on lap eight, Barker nailed the restart to pull two seconds clear ahead of a two-lap dash to the flag as Manchester battled a gear selection problem. Damage to Barker’s front splitter, however, allowed Manchester to close within 0.406 of a second at the line to claim his first Radical Challenge podium.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson came out on top of the thrilling three-way battle with Richards and Baxter, in which the trio constantly traded places for the final step on the podium, while Lang secured his best result of the weekend so far with important points for sixth. The Tyler / Gladdis duo doubled up with their second Team Challenge win of the weekend, again placing 13th overall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 3 / Round 15</strong></p>\n\n<p>Barker was on a mission from the rolling start of the 40-minute feature race, intent on building up enough of a margin to wipe out his 15 success seconds carried over from Rockingham. Leading the field from Burgess and Manchester, who once again delivered the best start to climb from seventh to fourth, Barker set off at a blistering pace and set eight consecutive fastest laps to pull out a nine second advantage before the pit window opened.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in the early stages Burgess headed the fight for second from Jackson and Manchester with Lang close behind in fifth and Baxter sixth.</p>\n\n<p>As Burgess, Jackson, Manchester and Lang all dived into the pits on lap 11, Barker maintained his momentum before pitting two laps later. As the pit stops played out, it was Jackson that emerged race leader with 0.547 in hand over Barker, followed by Manchester, Lang and Baxter. Burgess sat seventh having served a full 20-second success penalty following his Rockingham feature race victory.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson kept an impressive pace and looked to have the edge on Barker but a run wide into turn one was all the invitation Barker needed to re-take the top spot with eight minutes remaining. From there, Barker continued his outstanding form to pull out a five second advantage by the chequered flag.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson maintained his best performance of the season so far to score his highest podium finish in second, with Manchester third. Lang’s fourth place finish was enough to keep atop the title table, a spot he now shares with Barker, while Baxter and Burgess completed the top six.</p>\n\n<p>In the Team Challenge, Tyler and Gladdis also celebrated a clean sweep, sealing class victory 15th overall.</p>\n\n<p>Oliver Barker: “You can’t ask for much more than that, can you? What a great race and great way to finish the day. Nearly maximum points, which is what we needed coming into this weekend. With two rounds to go it’s all to play for now. Every lap had to be a qualifying lap in the final race, I was on the edge every lap. When I saw the chequered flag wave I was so happy.”</p>\n\n<p>Dominik Jackson: “It was a shame not to take the race win. I ran just a little bit wide at turn one. I’d got the measure of Oli for a couple of laps and had a gap, but it wasn’t to be. To get my highest position in race three for the most points was good.”</p>\n\n<p>Jack Manchester: “I think it was my start that really helped me out in that race. Going from seventh to fourth by the second corner, that made the difference. It’s a close field at the front and it can be such a hard track to overtake with everyone being so evenly matched, so that start definitely helped me.”</p>\n\n<p>For full race results visit <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com\">www.tsl-timing.com</a></p>"

Car counts have also been on the rise this year, with 23 cars starting at VIR compared to 17 in 2018, and 21 cars starting at Barber Motorsports Park compared to 19 at Canadian Tire Motorsports Park last year.</p>\n\n<p>“Like many of its drivers, this series has developed from a grassroots level. Now it’s genuinely one of the most popular championships in America and, unlike many, a true national series visiting tracks from coast to coast,\" commented series director and regional manager for Radical Sportscars, Tom Drewer.</p>\n\n<p>“To be able to give Radical drivers from across the continent the chance to showcase themselves in front of an IndyCar crowd at one of the preeminent circuits in America is a milestone moment, and it’s a testament to the caliber of drivers and competition we see in the Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup.”</p>\n\n<p>“The fantastic thing is we’ve got guys that have won high profile championships like George Kurtz [2017 Pirelli World Challenge GTSA Champion] racing alongside country club racers and, to be honest, rather green guys. But that’s what’s great about the Radical ecosystem. You can be an absolute novice or track day driver, or join a country club circuit, and then receive all the support and guidance required from our dealer network to hone your skills, race locally, then nationally in the Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup, and even across the world.”</p>\n\n<p>The Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup North America series is just one of numerous Radical Cups running around the globe– from the Caribbean to Canada, England to the Middle East, and Asia to Australia– allowing drivers to tick off bucket-list tracks such as Bathurst, Silverstone and Spa-Francorchamps after learning their craft in regional Radical competition.</p>\n\n<p>Radical’s weekend at Road America commences on Thursday June 20, with promoter test sessions, before official practice and qualifying on Friday, and three races spanning Saturday and Sunday.</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/race_day_infos/documents/000/000/060/original/2019-Radical-Cup-RD3-Entries.pdf?1560263912\">VIEW ENTRY LIST</a>"

Three different winners from three races in Cheshire – in Jerome de Sadeleer, Marcus Clutton and Jac Constable – have neatly balanced the standings. Clutton holds a slender 13-point advantage at the top of the table, but that counts for little when 210 points are up for grabs at each round…</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge field grows with a number of new faces joining the series from Silverstone onwards. Polish racer Jacek Zielonka joins the Radical Works Team in his SR3 RSX, the factory also fielding Mark Williams and Icelandic racer Audunn Gudmundsson, in the Team Challenge with Tom Ashton. They’ll be challenged by the new SR3 duo of Neil Glover and Jason Green, bringing established historic motorsport preparers Scott Sport to the Challenge paddock. Full Throttle Motorsports’ pairing of Nick Hull and Richard Avery also return to the Team Challenge class for the first time in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>2019 SR1 Cup champion Shane Stoney will be hoping for better results at Silverstone than his Oulton championship debut in the Solo Challenge, bolstered by the first 2020 series outings for fellow SR1 Cup alumni Peter Tyler, Martin Verity, Spencer Bourne and Chris Short. With the Silverstone ‘Festival’ offering an invitational class for SR1 racers, the grid welcomes seven current SR1 Cup protagonists including 2020 race-winners Dean Warriner and James Pinkerton (sharing with Ross Elliott)&nbsp;and fellow podium-sitter&nbsp;Mackenzie Walker.</p>\n\n<p>The qualifying action commences on Saturday morning before the first of two 50-minute enduros on Saturday afternoon. Unlike other rounds this season, the weekend features both the 20-minute sprint and second 50-minute pitstop race on Sunday, a fitting finale to this action-packed weekend. There’s still time for SR3 and SR1 racers to join the grid too – simply click the button below to visit our online entry system and register.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: Radical is working hard to run all UK race events in strict adherence with the UK Government’s COVID-19 regulations and requirements.

All Blue Marble Cocktails beverages are non-GMO, and feature ultra-premium distilled spirits, all-natural ingredients, no artificial sweeteners, dyes or preservatives, and come in environmentally friendly and recyclable packaging.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Marble Cocktails aligned with the 2018 Radical Cup North America series due to a passion for racing and extreme sports held by the brand’s founder and planetary ambassador, Alan Miller.</p>\n\n<p>“Blue Marble Cocktails is proud to support Radical and its mission to develop the world’s best high performance race cars,” notes Miller. “This is an excellent opportunity for us to introduce the Blue Marble Cocktails brand and our world-class beverages to a whole new audience in exciting event venues.”</p>\n\n<p>“Radical Sportscars is delighted to announce Blue Marble Cocktails as the title sponsor of the Radical Cup North America series. This partnership further elevates the status of the championship and is another huge coup after announcing every round of the 2018 season will be run and sanctioned under Pirelli World Challenge,” said Tom Drewer, Regional Manager North America, Radical Sportscars Ltd (UK).</p>\n\n<h3>With the championship now officially running under World Challenge and USAC sanctioning, and with the backing of new global technical partners Hankook and Motul, the level of competition is set to get hotter than ever.</h3>\n\n<p>All three of the 2017 Class Champions have returned with Richard Thomas (WISKO Racing) and Antoine Comeau (Team Stradale) defending the SR3 1500 and 1340 classes respectively. 2017 Masters Class Champion Jesse Menzcer (One Motorsport) makes the switch to the 1500 class this year, so expect the class to be highly competitive – look out for championship runner-up Ethan Stone also returning for a re-match with Richard Thomas.</p>\n\n<p>Young Norwegian sensation Theodor Olsen returns to the series and will be sharing an SR8 with a local, Texan Carlo Di Marco in the Masters Class, squaring up against rival Jim Booth. like Theodor, Booth will be racing in both the Radical Cup North America series, and its European counterpart, the Radical European Masters in 2018. Booth has both an RXC Spyder Turbo and SR8 at his disposal for COTA, and will field whichever he feels best suits the home of the American Grand Prix.</p>\n\n<p>A number of brand new cars are being raced for the very first time at COTA this weekend. Dennis Cox's SR3 RSX 1500 arrived in the country last week, as did that of Canadian Cup racer Matt Graham. Indeed, a strong Canadian continent makes up the grid, with no less than six drivers representing the Commonwealth country.</p>\n\n<p>New Texas dealer Moorespeed is running three cars, including the latest generation SR8 for Will Hardeman, who will be hoping for back-to-back wins after finding success in the Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge USA at the Sebring 12 Hour last weekend (Hardeman won Race 2 in the USA class). Moorespeed will also welcome Radical drivers and teams to their 5th Annual Race Welcome Party on Thursday 22nd March, held at the Moorespeed race shop in Austin – <strong><a href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/news/moorespeed-party\">click here for information.</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fans can follow all the action from the weekend through Radical North America's social media channels -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RadicalCUP\">https://twitter.com/RadicalCUP</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RadicalCUP/\">https://www.facebook.com/RadicalCUP/</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/north-american-cup\">RADICAL CUP NORTH AMERICA</a>"

The competition was fierce in all three classes, as was the racing between the front runners for the outright win. Antoine Comeau continued to be in a class of his own, winning all three races in the 1500 class. Dan McBreen also scored a hat-trick to dominate the 1340 class, while two wins for Will Lin helped move him to the top of the Masters class points table."

          "content": "<p>Twenty-one cars took to the grid for Races 4, 5 and 6 of the single-make championship which provided a popular modern twist to the HSR Barber Historics event, which featured a range of machinery including vintage Formula Juniors and classic GT cars.</p>\n\n<p>In his maiden event for 2019, Dan McBreen (Splunk / WISKO Racing) immediately made an impact by out qualifying the 1340 class series regulars, as well as a significant portion of the 1500 field. He then became the fourth different winner in the 1340 class, taking victory from Eric Wagner (Eastern / Turn 3 Motorsports) and Chris Souliotis (WISKO Racing).</p>\n\n<p>McBreen backed up his morning win with another convincing victory on Saturday afternoon, with Wagner and Souliotis replicating the result. However, Wagner and Souliotis had out qualified McBreen for the final race of the weekend, and initially it looked as though Souliotis would come out on top until a run through the gravel trap at the hairpin curtailed those plans. And after the mandatory pitstop window had closed it was again McBreen in command of the 1340 class from Wagner and Souliotis.</p>\n\n<p>While not taking any wins, Wagner’s consistency was rewarded. His three second place finishes moved him into the lead of the 1340 class championship (215), ten points clear of Souliotis (205).</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile Antoine Comeau (Eastern / Turn 3 Motorsports) continued to expand his points lead in the 1500 class and increased his winning streak to six. Comeau wasn’t without challenge though, with Jordan Missig drawing first blood in what was an abbreviated qualifying session after Gerhard Watzinger (CrowdStrike / One Motorsport) made heavy contact with the wall through Turn 13 and Louis Schriber (Shorewood Development Group / Team Stradale) spun coming down the corkscrew on the approach to the Museum corner.</p>\n\n<p>Impressively Watzinger’s One Motorsports team repaired his car in time for him to start the first race. From rear of the grid, Watzinger impressively carved his way up to eleventh outright and eight in class. In his first appearance for the year Todd Snyder (Aesthetic Dental Designs / One Motorsport) also impressed, moving from eleventh to seventh outright and finished fifth in class.</p>\n\n<p>At the front of the 1500 field, Jordan Missig (Team Stradale) fended off Antoine Comeau until they reached the hairpin for the second time, which also allowed Gustavo Rafols (WISKO Racing) to pounce. Missig then had a spin in the first sector, which allowed reigning champion Indy Al Miller (Blue Marble Cocktails / One Motorsport) to commence his advance through the field, which culminated in dispatching Rafols on Lap 11. Missig then clawed his way back into contention and salvaged his race by taking the remaining podium position away from Rafols five laps from the checkered flag. Both men benefitted from the late race yellow to recover a stricken Richard Durocher (WISKO Racing). Indicating just how competitive the 1500 class is this year, reigning 1340 champion Louis Schriber and 1500 championship runner-up Greg Gorski (smokebuddy / One Motorsport) could only manage sixth and seventh respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Like in Race 1, Comeau gapped 1500 field and concentrated on dicing with Will Lin for the outright lead. The to-and-fro battle concluded with Lin cracking with just two corners to go, allowing Comeau to not only clinch his fifth straight win in the series, but overall victory as well.</p>\n\n<p>Behind him, Schriber made an exciting pass on Gorski for seventh as the pair dispatched Dan Schildgen (Moorespeed), while trying to catch sixth placed Snyder. Watzinger progressed through the field, gaining two places to finish fifth in class, while Miller recovered from an opening lap mishap which dropped him to twelfth overall to finish fourth in class. Rafols held down third the entire race, while Missig ran strong in second.</p>\n\n<p>In his advance, Indy Al Miller set down a time good enough to be second fastest in class, and fourth on the grid for the final race. Impressively Todd Snyder also outqualified young-guns Rafols and Missig.</p>\n\n<p>Miller tailed Comeau for the opening laps, with Rafols also in pursuit after a stellar start. Then after a brief full course caution chaos ensued on Laps 4 and 5 chaos. Schriber was involved in an incident in the second to last corner with Terry Olson and Jim Booth, and then going through Turn 2 Indy Al Miller was sent into a spin after being accidently tagged by Judd Miller. While most of the drivers managed to avoid Miller including Watzinger who somehow skated by on the grass, Missig wasn’t so lucky and slammed into the front of the #500 Blue Marble machine. Amazingly, even with significant crash damage, both drivers continued.</p>\n\n<p>With the class order now Comeau, Rafols and Watzinger the pit window opened. Unlike VIR, none of the drivers were caught short in their mandatory pitstops. And with those stops complete, Comeau was now also in the outright lead, and he took the checker from Rafols and Gerhard Watzinger, whose podium place was a welcome reward after his qualifying crash. Schriber came home in fourth, with Snyder in fifth, while Missig had another ‘comeback kid’ moment, recovering to take sixth.</p>\n\n<p>After six races, Missig (246) is now locked in a three-point battle with Rafols (243) for second place in the 1500 championship, as the pair eye to somehow reign in Comeau’s expansive lead in the points (317).</p>\n\n<p>The top of the Masters class championship table, meanwhile, is now tighter than ever after the Barber event.</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly energized by his Race 3 win at VIR, Will Lin (Cameron Racing / Radical Northwest) made the most of the shortened qualifying session to put his SR8 on pole. He then led every lap of the first race at Barber, fending off the hard-charging 1500 of Antoine Comeau. Jim Booth (McDonald’s / WISKO Racing) initially looked set for second, but a gremlin in the fuel pump saw him tumble down to third and allowed Judd Miller (Miller Time Racing / Moorespeed) to capitalize. Terry Olson finished fourth, and series debutant Conrad Park rounded out the top five in class.</p>\n\n<p>With five 1500s separating Booth from Lin and Miller on Saturday afternoon’s grid, Booth was clearly focused on making the best start possible, but he blew it by jumping the start and having to relinquish the places he’d made up. Driving flawlessly lap after lap Lin for the longest time looked as though he’d go two for two. That was until he come unstuck on the second to last corner while being pressured by Comeau, who had decided he wanted the outright win. Stuck in the gravel, Lin had not only lost the overall lead, but more critically the Masters class win, which went to a surprised Judd Miller. Terry Olson and Jim Booth completed the podium, while Lin was classified fourth, and Scott Wagner (WISKO Racing) finished fifth.</p>\n\n<p>Lin again started from pole in Race 3, and therefore was ahead of the lap 3 and 4 melees, which ended Jim Booth’s race and relegated Terry Olson to third place. Judd Miller survived the contact with Indy Al Miller’s 1500 to finish second in class, while this time Will Lin decided discretion indeed was the better part of valor and relinquished the outright lead to Antoine Comeau to ensure he secured his second Masters class win of the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Lin’s win and Booth’s demise in Race 6 put the pair on equal championship points, but Lin’s bonus point for setting the fastest lap of the race has put him into the lead of the Masters class championship by the smallest of margins (239 to Booth’s 238). And now only ten points behind, Miller (228) and Olson (228) sit tied, but well in striking distance.</p>\n\n<p>The Barber event also featured plenty of off-track action, with drivers, friends and family enjoying catered breakfast and lunch in the Blue Marble hospitality tent, a private guided tour of the amazing Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum, a Saturday night Blue Marble cocktail party as well as group dinners at local restaurants.</p>\n\n<p>The series now gears up to star alongside the NTT IndyCar Series at Road America for the REV Group Grand Prix, June 20-23. The four-day event includes a Promotor Test Day on Thursday and will see the Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup series take to Elkhart Lake’s famous circuit more times than IndyCar. Current interest indicates the event could attract the largest group of Radicals to ever assemble in North America. Entries and fuel orders are due May 29.</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/radical-cup-north-america\">RADICAL CUP NORTH AMERICA</a>"

          "content": "The 2019 Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup North America season commenced with an ultra-competitive weekend at Virginia International Raceway, April 26-28. Twenty-three cars took to the track in front of large crowds and wowed with three-action packed races. Former champ Antoine Comeau started his season in spectacular style clinching all three victories in the cutthroat 1500 class, while Canadian Kevin Poitras struck first in 1340 and Jim Booth kicked off 2019 with two wins in the Masters class. Yet arguably the story of the weekend was fellow Masters class driver Will Lin overcoming significant adversity to triumph in the final race."

          "content": "<p>After much of Friday was washed out, drivers went into Saturday morning’s qualifying session with their work cut out. A drying track saw the times quicken throughout the session, and in the end it came down to a one-lap dash after a brief pause in the session to recover a stricken Will Lin (Radical Northwest / Cameron Racing). Jim Booth (McDonalds / WISKO Racing) was one of 13 drivers to set their best on their final tour, taking provisional pole in the Masters class. Louis Schriber (Shorewood Development / Team Stradale) eclipsed an earlier lap by Gustavo Rafols (WISKO Racing) by just 3 one-hundreds of a second to claim top honors in the 1500 class. Fellow WISKO Racing driver Chris Souliotis was another to capitalize, taking pole in the 1340 class.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nAs many of the drivers and teams, friends and family, participated in Saturday’s go-kart challenge, Radical Northwest worked over time to repair the front of Lin’s SR8, which had moved the Turn 1 tire wall a considerable distance. Amazingly Lin made Race 1 but started rear of field after stalling during the pitlane transit. After carving his way through the field, Lin again suffered a dramatic setback when a huge plume of smoke billowed from the back of his SR8 before he pulled off track midway through the race. Initially appearing catastrophic, the issue was in fact an oil filter O-ring failure, and Radical’s sophisticated LIFE ECU switched off his V8 engine before damage could be done.</p>\n\n<p>At around the same time Terry Olson (WISKO Racing), who had led from lap 5, relinquished the outright lead to WISKO teammate Jim Booth. Together they gave the home team a 1-2 in the Masters class, with Judd Miller (Moorespeed) completing the podium.</p>\n\n<p>Finishing an impressive second outright, after a stellar start and flawless drive, Antoine Comeau (Eastern / Turn 3 Motorsports) rewarded Turn 3 Motorsports with a win in their series debut. In stark contrast, there wasn’t any smooth sailing for Comeau’s closest 1500 class rivals. Louis Schriber (3rd), was found to have passed in a yellow sector of the circuit, and a lap later was helped off the track by Gustavo Rafols (2nd). Both were served with post-race time penalties for their indiscretions, but such was the gap to Jordan Missig (4th), they retained their places on the podium.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly all four have stepped up to the 1500 class this year hoping to replicate the success they’ve had in 1340. Schriber is the reigning 1340 class champion, Rafols is the 2018 runner up, Missig is a regional race winner, and Comeau is the 2017 1340 champion.</p>\n\n<p>Adding to the caliber of the 1500 field, Gerhard Watzinger (CrowdStrike Racing / One Motorsports, 5th) has returned to Radical Cup racing after years of IMSA Prototype Lites. Highlighting just how competitive the class is in 2019, last year’s vice-champion, Greg Gorski (smokebuddy / One Motorsports) could only manage 6th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Radical Canada East racing team made a spectacular start to their season, having signed two Trans-Am drivers for 2019. Kevin Poitras (MBRP / Radical Canada East) won his first Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup race, with fellow debutant and teammate Ron Keith (Post Plastics / Power Bus Way / Radical Canada East) home second. WISKO Racing’s Jon Hanson was third.</p>\n\n<p>On Sunday morning came the news Poitras wasn’t well enough to race, leaving Keith to carry the Canadian team’s hopes. Keith didn’t disappoint, leading the 1340 class from start to finish to give the team two wins in a row. This time it was Chris Souliotis second, while John Hanson scored another podium finish. Eric Wagner (Eastern / Turn 3 Motorsports) also impressed in Race 2, recording the fastest 1340 lap of the race.</p>\n\n<p>Antoine Comeau and Turn 3 Motorsport continued their winning ways in the 1500 class on Sunday, and Rafols continued to play bridesmaid. However, this time it was Jordan Missig (3rd) who joined Comeau and Rafols (2nd) on the podium. Further down the field multiple battles raged, including a race long bout between Dan Schildgen (Moorespeed, 9th) and Gary Ball (AMS / WISKO Racing, 10th).</p>\n\n<p>Eyes were also on the fight for second in the Masters class. Working his way up from tenth on the grid, Will Lin picked off Judd Miller before chasing down Terry Olson. However, with the gap less than 2 seconds Lin spun on lap 13 and tumbled down the order. With the pressure off Olson retained second place behind Jim Booth, while Judd Miller inherited third. Impressively Miller had also recorded the second fastest time of the race, meaning he would start on the front row of the grid for race 3..&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Initially in Race 3 it looked as though Booth would record a clean sweep. Leading until the mandatory pitstop, a mistake saw Booth short-stop by 14 seconds resulting in a ‘stop and hold’ penalty. After passing Olson for second Lin was also looking strong having had hunted down Booth– prior to the pitstops the gap was only two-tenths. However just as it looked as though Lin would salvage his horrid weekend, he too was hit with a penalty for short stopping.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily for Lin his pace had been spectacular and after serving his 6 second ‘stop and hold’ he came out in front of Booth to take the outright victory and the Masters class win. The win was a just reward for the Radical Northwest / Cameron Racing squad after the countless hours put in to get Lin back on track, and an impressive feat given VIR was Lin’s first event behind the wheel of his new SR8. Booth held on to second place, with Terry Olson completing the podium. Scott Wagner (WISKO Racing) had an impressive run in his V8 powered Spyder to finish 4th.</p>\n\n<p>Antoine Comeau and Turn 3 Motorsport went three for three to start their 2019 championship campaign in the best possible way. Comeau was lucky to escape a clash with Rafols and Schriber when the three went for the same piece of tarmac as the green flag flew. Schriber spun, as did the following Missig. And while Gustavo Rafols survived that melee, his luck ran out six laps later, with a suspected upright failure preventing him securing another second place finish.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At that point it looked as though One Motorsports was set to score a podium or two, with Gerhard Watzinger and Greg Gorski sitting third and fourth. However, Watzinger found the wall on lap 8, and Gorski was leapfrogged in the pits by eventual podium placers Louis Schriber (2nd) and Jordan Missig (3rd), who both had remarkable comebacks. The latter’s stop was timed to perfection by Team Stradale, coming within seven one-hundreds of the minimum stop time.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1340 class, the pitstops didn’t appear to make or break the race. Instead it was the pace of rookie John Hanson, who found a full second over his personal best in Race 2. Hanson further impressed by soaking up the pressure to secure his first Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup victory. Ron Keith came away with another podium, this time second place, while Chris Souliotis also finished the weekend strong with third.</p>\n\n<p>It was clear from the large crowd, which gathered to watch the champagne being sprayed for the final time, that the Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup had been a fan favorite during the Blancpain GT World Challenge weekend at Virginia International Raceway.</p>\n\n<p>The series now heads to Barber Motorsports Park where it will provide a modern twist the HSR Barber Historics event, May 17-19, before joining the NTT IndyCar Series for the REV Group Grand Prix at Road America, June 20-23.

          "content": "<p>The fun started on Friday night with an endurance karting competition. Over 40 drivers, crew, friends and family as well as representatives from Hankook Tire and Radical took part in the mayhem. After the dust had settled, it was Dennis Cox’s team who officially took the win, although there was talk that computer hacking and bribery may have helped steal the win away from Radical personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\nThe off-track antics continued on Saturday night during the Blue Marble afterparty, with all sampling the hand-crafted all-natural ultra-premium cocktails and hors d’oeuvres, but nothing compared to the action on-track.</p>\n\n<p>Newcomer Judd Miller made his mark in the Masters Class, driving his Moorespeed prepared SR8 to three podium places. His progression through the weekend evident in the final race of the weekend when he finished just seconds behind current class championship leader Terry Olson (WISKO Racing).</p>\n\n<p>While three second places maintained his points lead, Olson was unlucky not to walk away with a win in his brand new SR8. The WISKO driver was essentially robbed in Race 1 after teammate Jim Booth slowed in the dying stages of the race, parking his older SR8 machine on the apex of Turn 1. With Race Control concerned for Booth’s safety a Red Flag was thrown, controversially taking the race results back a lap, and handing the win to Booth.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t the only mechanical gremlin for Booth over the weekend– he also had to limp home Race 2– but in terms of sheer pace he set the benchmark in the Masters class and entirely deserved of his three wins, which moved him into second in the class points. No doubt Booth’s Radical European Masters experience at fast flowing tracks across the Atlantic tracks had prepared him well for Utah Motorsports Campus.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nLike Booth, Indy Al Miller was in a league of his own in the 1500 class. The Blue Marble Cocktails driver seemed determined to stamp his authority over championship rival and One Motorsports teammate Greg Gorski (Smoke Buddy). To make matters worse for Gorski, Ron Fletcher and Will Lin’s impressive performances thwarted his damage limitation as all three raced to be second best.</p>\n\n<p>Amazingly Miller didn’t only win class in all three races, but outright, with his pace often matching that of Booth’s V8 powered machine. However, for the first few laps of Race 1 it was Fletcher who led the 1500 class, until he came unglued on Turn 3. While he returned to the track in a plume of dust, the excursion released Miller, Gorski and Lin– the eventual 1500 class podium. Fletcher recovered to take fourth from Dennis Cox (Moorespeed) and Rod Rice, who finishing sixth was best of the rookies.</p>\n\n<p>Fletcher found his way past Gorski in Race 2 to take the second step of the podium, while Rice went one better to finish fifth ahead of Cox and Tad Cusack (Cusack Racing) finished an impressive seventh in class and tenth outright.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\nGorski’s frustration furthered in Race 3. Not only did Fletcher settle into second place but Lin (Radical Northwest / Cameron Racing) gained pace and track position early on, and then maintained it through the mandatory pitstops to score third. Behind Gorski, Rice and Cox finished fifth and six again, while Jeff Wright wowed his Radical Northwest / Cameron Racing team with seventh in class. Not only had the rookie finished up the order, Wright’s pace had picked up by nearly 30 seconds from Friday’s first session.</p>\n\n<p>Miller’s hat-trick of 1500 class wins allowed him to overtake the absent Antoine Comeau in the outright championship fight, meaning he is now first in-line for the prize drive with Radical’s Works Team in England. Gorski also leaped over Comeau in the hunt for the outright title, but he slipped further behind Miller in the 1500 class points. Lin’s Utah performance has started to cement third place in the 1500 class points, while Ron Fletcher rocketed up the leaderboard to close in on Dennis Cox.</p>\n\n<p>Comeau’s no-show was also a chance for championship hopefuls Gustavo Rafols (WISKO Racing), Louis Schriber (Team Stradale) and Chris Souliotis (WISKO Racing) to catch back up to the 1340 points leader.</p>\n\n<p>Schriber fired the first shot, qualifying fastest of the 1340 drivers, commenting that UMC reminded him of the South configuration of his home track Autobahn Country Club. Yet it was young-gun Gustavo Rafols, who was coming off the back of an outstanding win in the rain in Canada, who came away with the Race 1 win. Stuck behind a V8 and 1500 competitors Schriber had to settle for second, with Souliotis third.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\nRafols looked set to secure another win in Race 2 until lady luck struck on Lap 13. A gearbox glitch handed Schriber the win and Souliotis second place.</p>\n\n<p>With limited time before the third race, it seemed unlikely that Rafols would have his repairs done in time until Schriber committed the ultimate act of sportsmanship lending Rafols his spare car. This allowed Rafols to salvage valuable points, but with the added disadvantage of starting rear of field, he never really threatened in Race 3.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it was his WISKO team, who came away with the win in the 1340 class, after timing Chris Souliotis’s pitstop to perfection. It was the Canadian’s first class victory in the Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup series.</p>\n\n<p>Schriber’s second place, added to his strong points haul to move within five points of Comeau in the 1340 standings, while Souliotis and Rafols have moved into third and fourth in the points respectively, setting up an exciting bout for the remaining rounds.</p>\n\n<p>The series now heads back east to Watkins Glen International raceway for Round 5 of the championship. Over 20 Radicals have already entered the August 31 – September 2 Pirelli World Challenge event.</p>"

I want to thank Chris Bye and the team at FEL Motorsports, along with Honda Indy Toronto, and Radical’s official tire partner Hankook for working with us to make this happen.”</p>\n\n<p>Set at Exhibition Place in the heart of Toronto, the Honda Indy boasts tens of thousands of spectators for a three-day festival event. With last year’s Sunday grandstand tickets selling out, it’s a fan favorite which , as reported by the Toronto Star, is equally loved by the drivers. Scott Dixon, the 2022 winner commented, “It’s a circuit you can really attack on. Some tracks you’re, like, on attack and you can go only eight out of 10. But here, it’s 12 out of 10. It’s like a bit of a bull ring. You can’t let up.”</p>\n\n<p>The Blue Marble Radical Cup is only weeks away from its season opener at NOLA Motorsports Park, March 9-12, where the series will feature alongside Trans Am, FR Americas and F4 United States. The series will then support the NTT INDYCAR SERIES for three events in a row–&nbsp;during the Honda Indy Grand Prix of Alabama at Barber Motorsports Park, April 28-30, the Sonsio Grand Prix presented by AMR at Road America, June 15-18 and the Honda Indy Toronto, July 14-16. Texas is the penultimate stop for the Blue Marble Radical Cup where it joins fellow USAC sanctioned series Porsche Sprint Challenge and the USF Pro Championships at Circuit of the Americas, Aug. 25-27, before a fitting season finale with INDYCAR at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca for the Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey, Sept. 8-10.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/015/original/Screenshot_urd_radical_sr3xxr_2023_toronto_15-1-123-23-27-20.jpg?1676543012 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/015/std/Screenshot_urd_radical_sr3xxr_2023_toronto_15-1-123-23-27-20.jpg?1676543012\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/003/015/std/Screenshot_urd_radical_sr3xxr_2023_toronto_15-1-123-23-27-20.jpg?1676543012\"></p>\n\n<p>“With more high-profile events Radical continues to attract rising stars from the country club and premium GT sportscar categories along with young karters and open-wheel drivers looking for an alternative pathway into prototypes and the upper echelons of the sport,” added Drewer.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Marble Radical Cup events are open to all local and regional Radical racers with eligible cars to participate.

He’ll face stiff competition in the class for 1340cc SR3s including reigning Radical Cup Canada East champ Austin Riley (Racing with Autism). The same same trio of drivers from Apex Motor Club are also returning– Jason Plotke, Vince Switzer and Chris McMurry (Crown Concepts)– who took numerous podium places during last year’s Barber event.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/619/original/33.jpg?1651162924 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/619/std/33.jpg?1651162924\" width=\"466\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/619/std/33.jpg?1651162924\"></p>\n\n<p><em>Indy Al Miller, 2021</em></p>\n\n<p>The PRO 1500 class will be equally competitive with Gustavo Rafols (WISKO Racing) returning to defend his outright and class champions’ titles. He’ll also be facing fellow young-gun Palmer Miller (ESSES Racing)– who took two wins at Barber last year– and series stalwart Gregg Gorski (Cock Oil / ONE Motorsports). Miller and Gorski finished second and third in the points last year and are both gunning for the 2022 title.</p>\n\n<p>Junior open wheel star-come-Radical rookie, Reece Everard (Wicked Sweet / Group-A), has burst onto the scene and was fastest during the pre-season test at Barber which makes him the favorite heading into the weekend. Another name to keep an eye on is Mark Allan (ONE Motorsports) who makes his return to national level Radical racing after seven years.</p>\n\n<p>Missing from the 1500 ranks is Steve Jenks (Audien Hearing / Group-A), who has stepped up to the Platinum class and the 425bhp, 380lb-ft ‘torque monster’ Radical SR10 for 2022. With Jenks joining, expect at least a five-way fight in the fastest class as former ALMS champ Jon Field (Bricker Design / Scott Wagner Racing), Judd Miller (ESSES Racing) and Louis Schriber III (Shorewood Development / RYNO Racing) try to topple Indy Al Miller (Blue Marble / ONE Motorsport). Miller is attempting to pull off a hattrick, after taking the 2020 PRO 1500 and 2021 Platinum class titles.</p>\n\n<p>Two promoter test sessions and an official practice session today are followed by practice, qualifying and Race 1 on Friday, and Race 2 and 3 on Saturday.

          "content": "<p>It was not long after the green flag flew that the caution would be displayed during race nine of the multi-class championship. A first-corner incident saw six drivers off the track during the opening lap including Pro 1500 contenders Aurora Straus (ONE Motorsport), Jack Yang (Group-A Racing), Dave Tweedlie (RYNO Racing) and Richard Durocher (WISKO Racing), as well as Pro 1340 competitors of Ben Blander (Team Stradale) and Mike D’Ambrose (Team Stradale).</p>\n\n<p>Up front in the Platinum class, it was Indy Al Miller (ONE Motorsports) who closed his weekend on a high after a tough fought battle with Steve Jenks (Group-A Racing) to finish the final race of the weekend on top. Alain Derzie (ONE Motorsports) rebounded from having his Saturday podium result stripped to a second place finish thanks a daring pass on Jason Plotke (Crown with Apex) through the famous kink. Jenks salvaged third after contact with Miller into Turn 6 while vying for the lead that sent him into a spin. In fact, Jenks earned the fastest lap of the race on his final tour as he made a run at Derzie but finished just .250 in arrears of the second-place finisher. Plotke looked as though he would take second until Derzie and Jenks charged through, but nevertheless completed a consistent weekend with a fourth position, while former dirt-track racer turned Radical driver Wayne Williams (Esses Racing) earned fifth. A lack luster seventh place finish for Jon Field (ONE Motorsports) has seen his points buffer reduced to 32 over Indy Al Miller halfway through the championship.</p>\n\n<p>Danny Dyszelski (WISKO Racing) looked set to extend his point lead in the Pro 1500 ranks, finishing 1.5 seconds ahead of Nick Persing (Radical Northwest) when the checkers came out. The pair had an amazing battle which saw Persing rebound after a first lap mishap to take the class lead. A dual with Dyszelski then ensued culminating with the WISKO driver attempting a pass into Turn 6. In a post-race review it was determined the pass was incomplete as the pair entered the yellow sector caused by Jenk’s spin, and Dyszelski was handed a post-race drive through relegating him to sixth. This elevated Persing to the win, and a six point lead over Dyszelski in both the outright championship and the Pro 1500 points battle. RySpec Racing driver Robert Soroka added another podium to his growing resume, classified in the final results in second, while fellow Canadian Austin Riley (Racing With Autism) moved up to third, for his&nbsp; best result of the weekend. Gregg Gorski (ONE Motorsports) and David Alban (WISKO Racing) rounded out the top-five and will look to battle again in Toronto.</p>\n\n<p>Gavin Sanders (Radical Canada East) went three-for-three on the weekend in the Pro 1340 class as he had a perfect event once the wheel-to-wheel action commenced. In a similar result to yesterday, Sanders earned the win ahead of Robert Cipriani (Team Stradale) as Ken Savage (G-Tech Motorsports) rounded out the podium. Saturday’s sixth-place finisher of Seth Bacon (Crown Racing) improved on Sunday to put his Crown Racing machine in the fourth position, just ahead of Andy Voekel (Crown Racing) in fifth place, but the latter was later penalized along with Ben Blander for his role in the Turn 1 mayhem, elevating teammate Evan Wolf to fifth. Ken Savage’s consistency proved key this weekend as he quietly increased his lead over Steve Bacon to 18 points in the Pro 1340 championship.</p>\n\n<p>“What a weekend with IndyCar at Road America,” commented Radical’s Tom Drewer. “The competition in this series continues to grow, and despite a few full course cautions we saw some truly outstanding racing in each of the three classes. We’re off to Canada now for the Hondy Indy on the Streets of Toronto July 14-16, where the Blue Radical Cup North America Series will team up with FEL’s Emzone Radical Cup Canada series. It promises to be another big grid.”</p>\n\n<p>Next month’s event will be the first ever street circuit for the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America program. Be sure to stay tuned to the Blue Marble Radical Cup social media pages for news, information, photos, and results from the event weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Marble Radical Cup events are open to all local and regional Radical racers with eligible cars to participate.

          "content": "<p><strong>October 26, 2022</strong> – A year's worth of hard work, sweat and accomplishments come down to this weekend at the famed Sonoma Raceway. With the final event of the 2022 Blue Marble Radical Cup North America program on the horizon, all competitors will have three more opportunities to stand atop the podium while a select few will battle for the championship in their respective classes. With tight point battles across all three classes, the Overall Championship is also up for grabs as more than 20 drivers will hit the track this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Seven Platinum competitors will pilot SR10 machines during the final event of the 2022 season while four have a shot at being crowned champion. In the closest point battle across all three classes, Steve Jenks (Group-A Racing / Audien Hearing) enters the weekend eight points ahead of Robert Rossi (Wisko Racing) and Jon Field (One Motorsports / Bricker Home Design) who are tied for second, while Judd Miller (Esses Racing / Radical Texas) is still an outside chance trailing by a further 31 points. However, with Rossi’s name absent from the current entry list, it will be a three-horse race as Jenks aims to keep the former American Le Mans Series LMP1 champ behind him, and Miller looks to eclipse them both.</p>\n\n<p>Perennial front-runners Scott Wagner (Scott Wagner Racing / Scott Wagner Integrated Medicine) and Jim Booth (Wisko Racing / McDonalds) also hope to finish their season on a high as they throw their hats into the mix in the quest for as many championship points as possible. A pair of new drivers will join the Platinum class at the Sonoma Raceway with Jason Greenwood piloting the AMI Information Systems-backed Ryno Racing SR10 and former Road to Indy competitor Charles Finelli making the switch to the Radical series with outfit Fat Boy Racing.</p>\n\n<p>The Pro 1500 side of the program is led by Palmer Miller (Esses Racing / Radical Texas) who seemingly has the class championship in his grasp with the biggest lead in all three Radical Cup point battles. Entering the weekend 78 markers ahead of his closest rival, Miller will be looking to keep his nose clean and avoid unnecessary risks. While Miller is ahead of the points table, teammate Kent Myers sits second, 75 points ahead of reigning Pro 1500 and Overall Series Champion Gustavo Rafols (Wisko Racing). With Rafols skipping the event to focus his full attention on the Radical World Finals Presented by Hankook, the championship will come down to Miller and Myers in Napa Valley, however with 11 drivers entered in the highly competitive Pro 1500 class, expect many more to be vying for the race wins this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Multi-podium placegetter Aurora Straus (Group-A Racing / Richard Miller / Arch Capital) returns to take on Sonoma, and hopefully help Group-A to the team championship. Radical Northwest Cameron Racing is entering a strong contingent of drivers with local track knowledge–&nbsp;Dan Decker, Arul Venkatesh, Joe Nuxoll, and Richard McDougall. Will Lin is making his 2022 debut with One Motorsport, as is Jesse Menczer (DiscTech) who will race alongside Gregg Gorski (Smokebuddy), who took two podiums at COTA. The highly competitive Californian Ron Fletcher also returns to the Radical ranks this weekend with Ryno Racing.</p>\n\n<p>The Pro 1340 class championship has flip-flopped all season long with Austin Riley (Racing with Autism / SparkPower / Lincoln Electric) entering the season's final event at the head of the field. The reigning 2021 Radical Cup Canada champion regained the point lead during the final wheel-to-wheel action at the Circuit of the Americas (COTA) last month and leads the 1340 class and the Overall championship table. Mike Anzaldi (Ryno Racing / Emmett’s Energy) has been pushing Riley throughout the season and if it wasn’t for a mistake during race three at COTA, would be the points leader today. Riley and Anzaldi will be a duo to watch in a battle that will rage on this weekend. Reid Stewart (Group-A Racing / Fasano Textiles) enters the weekend third in the title chase and will need a miracle to take the championship ahead of Riley and Anzaldi but will aim to finish his 2022 campaign on a high. Brendan Wright (Radical Northwest / Cameron Racing) will look to fight for the podium in his first event of the 2022 race season.</p>\n\n<p>Set to hit the track on Friday for test and practice sessions, Blue Marble Radical Cup North America competitors will shift their focus to qualifying and the first race on Saturday with two more wheel-to-wheel races on Sunday as the 2022 season ends.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/868/original/1.jpg?1666967885 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/868/std/1.jpg?1666967885\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/868/std/1.jpg?1666967885\"></p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3>Weekend Quick Links</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Sonoma Event Schedule</strong> – <a href=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/race_day_infos/documents/000/000/126/original/2022-Radical-Cup-RD6-Schedule.pdf?1661020464\">Click HERE</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sonoma Track Map</strong> – <a href=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/race_day_infos/documents/000/000/131/original/2022-Radical-Cup-RD6-TrackMap.pdf?1664395092\">Click HERE</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sonoma Entry List</strong> – <a href=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/race_day_infos/documents/000/000/133/original/2022-Radical-Cup-RD6-Entries.pdf?1664394491\">Click HERE</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sonoma Night of Champions</strong> – <a href=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/race_day_infos/documents/000/000/156/original/2022-Radical-Cup-RD6-NightofChampions.pdf?1666277409\">Click HERE</a></p>\n\n<p>Registration for the Radical World Finals Presented by Hankook at the picturesque Spring Mountain Resort and Country Club is open. <a href=\"https://usaentries.radicalmotorsport.com/registered_users/sign_in\">Register NOW</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Radical Cup</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.RadicalMotorsport.com\">www.RadicalMotorsport.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Social Media: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/Radical_Cup\">@Radical_Cup</a></p>"

          "content_type": "bodyText",
          "content": "<p>A number of fresh faces joined series stalwarts including three father and son duos celebrating Father’s Day. Making their debuts were Jeff and Noah Ping, who both recently graduated from Primal Racing School at Atlanta Motorsport Park, former American Le Mans Series LMP champions John and Clint Field, who co-drove their Radical Spyder V8, and Palmer Miller, who has joined his father Judd in the Blue Marble Radical Cup.</p>\n\n<p>The caliber of the field was further bolstered by the return of George Kurtz (2017 Pirelli World Challenge GTSA champion) and the addition of 2018 F2000 champion Steve Jenks with New York’s Group-A Racing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>PRO 1340 CLASS</h3>\n\n<p>With the proximity of Road America to Illinois’ Autobahn County Club, where Radical’s SR3 1340 is the most popular car, it was anticipated their members would dominate the 1340 class. While Chris Kemp (Team Stradale) qualified on pole for Race 1, it was clear the prediction would be challenged with long time MASTERS competitor Jim Booth (McDonald’s / WISKO Racing) second fastest after making the switch to 1340 this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sporadic rain and a late full course caution in Race 1 resulted in a four-way fight for the podium places, which saw Kemp cross the line just barely in front of Booth, Mike Anzaldi (Emmett’s Energy / Anzaldi GP) and John Rante (Team Stradale). On the podium, Kemp was visibly emotional having taken his maiden series victory.</p>\n\n<p>In the torrential conditions of Race 2, Booth’s years of Radical experience came to the forefront as he masterfully finished ninth outright– the only 1340 in the top ten– to take the class win from Kemp and Anzaldi. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Booth’s pace also gave him the class pole for Race 3, but that proved disastrous as it placed him in the middle of a start line incident, finishing his race literally as the green flag was still being waived. Avoiding the mayhem Kemp went on to claim his second win of the weekend, with Anzaldi and Rante completing the podium, and Bob Iversen (WISKO Racing) finishing a solid fourth.</p>\n\n<h3>PRO 1500 CLASS</h3>\n\n<p>With 17 cars, PRO 1500 was the most competitive class and produced amazing racing throughout the weekend. One Motorsports team owner Jeff Shafer reported Indy Al Miller had an air of confidence throughout the 3.75 hours of testing on Thursday, and didn’t want to “show all his cards”. However, hometown hero Schriber pipped the 2018 PRO 1500 champion in qualifying, while One Motorsports had to be content with setting the other four of the top five fastest times.</p>\n\n<p>A terrific scrap in Race 1 resulted in the top 8 cars in the 1500 class running line astern in the drizzle with Indy Al Miller (Blue Marble) taking the win from One Motorsports teammates George Kurtz (CrowdStrike) and Alain Derzie (Derzie Racing). Notable drives also came from Steve Jenks (Group-A Racing), who finished fourth, along with young guns Palmer Miller (ESSES Racing, 6th) and Noah Ping (PRIMAL Racing, 7th).</p>\n\n<p>Louis Schriber (Team Stradale) fought back in the rain of Race 2 to challenge Indy Al Miller for the lead heading into Canada corner but spun in the process before recovering to finish second. George Kurtz gained another podium, while Gregg Gorski (Smokebuddy / One Motorsports) impressed in fourth and Palmer Miller surprised with fifth in his first ever rain race.</p>\n\n<p>After the mandatory pitstops shuffled the order in Race 3, the two CrowdStrike cars of George Kurtz and Gerhard Watzinger were first and second, with Steve Jenks looking like he might claim trophy in his first Radical Cup weekend. However a fast charging Indy Al Miller had other ideas, and dispatched Jenks to give One Motorsports another clean sweep of the podium. Palmer Miller and Noah Ping again showed they would be stars of the future, finishing sixth and seventh respectively, and the former’s impressive debut was acknowledged with a special prize from Gulf Racing Fuels.</p>\n\n<h3>MASTERS CLASS</h3>\n\n<p>Reigning class champion Judd Miller (ESSES Racing) definitely arrived at Road America as the favorite but John Field (WISKO Racing) surprised many by putting the older SPYDER V8 on the outright pole. The straight-line speed differential between the slender SR8s and the wider SPYDER was on display at the start of Race 1 as both Dave Tweedlie (Team Tweedlie Racing) and Miller passed Field into the first turn. Miller then held a commanding lead for two thirds of the race until the late race showers caught him out in Turn 14. His spin prompted a safety car which led to an amazing moment of courage as Field passed both Terry Olson (Team Fury) and Tweedlie around the outside of Turn 1 to take the win. Miller recovered to finish fourth in class.</p>\n\n<p>With rain falling and frantic work being conducted by all the teams to change onto wet tires on the grid, Olson was noticeably calm before Race 2. As the wet conditions caught out Field and Tweedlie, Olson showed he was in a league of his own. Even a redeeming drive from Miller (2nd) couldn’t topple the Team Fury driver who won by a staggering 19 seconds. Recovering from his early spin, Field brought home his wounded car in third.</p>\n\n<p>Inspired by his Saturday afternoon drive, Terry Olson never looked back in Sunday’s sunshine, and claimed victory in Race 3 with another brilliant drive. Behind him though, disaster struck Judd Miller, whose throttle cable broke as the green flag flew and John Field was sidelined by a mechanical failure after a solid first stint by son Clint. Dave Tweedlie scored another second place with a strong run and clean pitstop, while Conrad Park completed the podium, meaning ESSES racing still had something to smile about.</p>\n\n<p>Teams and drivers will now focus on preparing for Barber Motorsports Park, July 31- Aug 2. With two race wins apiece Terry Olson (MASTERS), Indy Al Miller (PRO 1500) and Chris Kemp (PRO 1340) lead their respective class championships.</p>\n\n\n    <a class=\"panel__inner--button button--centered\" onclick=\"\" href=\"https://www.radicalsportscars.com/go-racing/radical-cup-north-america\">RADICAL CUP NORTH AMERICA</a>"

Gaskell is a seasoned entrepreneur and CEO, with a track record that has seen him build over £3 billion in shareholder value during his extensive career. A Structural Engineer by training, Gaskell transferred to management accountancy, and soon found a home in the UK automotive sector.</p>\n\n<p>Gaskell served as Managing Director of Porsche Cars Great Britain, before transferring to BMW Great Britain as Group CEO. Gaskell has held senior executive roles in automotive related companies including epyx, EurotaxGlass’s and Motoriety. He currently enjoys an active interest in several other businesses including The Data Support Agency, the Health and ITS Technology Group, Safety Dialogue Company and Smarter Britain. Outside of the Boardroom, Gaskell is a world record holding trans-Atlantic rower, public speaker and author.</p>\n\n<p>Radical Sportscars has also promoted Dan Redpath to Group Sales and Marketing Director, and is the latest addition to its board, where he joins Joe Anwyll (CEO), and Hitesh Katechia (Chairman of the Board and CFO) and Jan Osterloh.</p>\n\n<p>Redpath joined the company in January 2020 from Aston Martin, where he held a number of senior commercial posts.&nbsp; Since joining Radical as Global Sales Director, he has spearheaded the company's expansion, appointing 12 new dealers and successfully launching the new SR3 XX and SR10 models, the latter being the fastest-selling model in Radical’s history. The brand is now represented by 31 dealers in 21 countries, making it the most successful race car dealer network in the world.&nbsp; Redpath’s appointment as Group Sales and Marketing Director marks a critical juncture, allowing greater synergy between the two teams.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking at Radical Sportscars’ Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, headquarters and factory, Kevin Gaskell, Non-Executive Director said: “This is an exciting appointment for me, and I’m thrilled to be joining the board at such an exciting time in Radical’s history. The staff at Radical are some of the most experienced and passionate motorsport specialists I’ve ever met, and Radical is currently enjoying extremely strong demand for its new SR3 XX and the turbocharged SR10, which is the fastest-selling model in Radical’s history.</p>\n\n<p>“To be invited to work with Dan, Hitesh, Jan and Joe on guiding the company as it builds on this success, and help shape its future over the coming decade, is a privilege.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dan Redpath, Group Sales and Marketing Director echoed this, adding: “One of Radical's most valuable assets is its agility, allowing the company to move quickly and respond to rapidly changing market conditions. The new SR10 is testament to this, having been developed and launched during last year’s Covid-19 lockdowns, and SR10 really put us in a great position with a very strong orderbook as the world opened up again.</p>\n\n<p>“We have experienced unprecedented demand for our hand-built products since last year, and that would not have been possible without the support of our employees, our 31-strong dealer network and not least our incredibly loyal customer base.&nbsp; The Radical team is really looking forward to some exciting developments in the short to medium. And to be a part of steering the future from a board perspective makes it even more thrilling for me.”</p>\n\n<p>Joe Anwyll, Radical Sportscars’ CEO, said: “I am delighted to welcome Kevin Gaskell and Dan Redpath to the Radical board. These appointments recognise how the business is maturing and that it is ready to take the next step in its ambitious growth plans.”</p>\n\n<p>Radical Sportscars is enjoying its most successful year to date and has just built the 50th Radical SR10 since build started in late 2020, making it the fastest-selling model in the company’s history. The company is looking forward to its 25th anniversary year in 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notes to Editors</strong></p>\n\n<p>Founded in 1997, Radical Sportscars is headquartered in Peterborough, UK and is responsible for developing, manufacturing and racing - through its Works and private teams - a comprehensive range of purpose-built racing sportscars through single-marque racing series at world renowned race circuits.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the Radical Sportscars line-up features the entry-level SR1, boasting 182 bhp and a top speed of 138 mph, the SR3, capable of 226 bhp and a top speed of 147 mph, and the all-new SR10, launched in 2021 and as Radical’s first turbo charged SR model, sitting at the top of the high-downforce family of models, alongside the iconic SR8 and RXC models.</p>\n\n<p>Known as one of the largest producers of racing and track cars in the world selling over 2,500 cars globally over the past two decades, Radical has operations in over 21 countries (through 31 dealers) and organises a range of single-marque series’ in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, UAE, Scandinavia, Romania, Iberia, South Korea and the Caribbean.

          "content": "<p>The Radical Challenge Championship kicked off the 2017 season in style on Saturday 22 April, with 32 entrants delivering a dramatic day of racing action at Donington Park. Multiple Radical UK and European Champion, Bradley Smith opened his 2017 account with two trips to the top of podium but was unable to seal a hat-trick due to a mechanical issue while leading race three.</p>\n\n<p>If the first qualifying session of the year is anything to go by, the 2017 Radical Challenge field is set to deliver a stunning season of fierce competition, as 1.1 seconds covered the top eight cars and 1.9 seconds separated pole and 21st on the grid. </p>\n\n<p>Reigning Radical Challenge Champion, Steve Burgess set the early pace in dry and cool qualifying conditions on Saturday morning, before eventual pole-sitter Bradley Smith commanded the top spot. The Mectech Motorsport driver didn’t have it all his own way, however, as Radical SR1 graduate Oliver Barker closed to within 0.002 off Smith’s then best time before locking out the front row 0.147 seconds adrift. </p>\n\n<p>Burgess kept in close contention to qualify third, three tenths of a second off pole, while Harry Cockill clocked in fourth fastest, 0.092 seconds further back. Qualifying fifth overall, Tom Harvey topped the Team Challenge cars while Jack Manchester delivered an impressive debut to round out the top six.</p>\n\n<p>The 2017 Radical Challenge season got properly underway with the first 20-minute sprint race under sunny skies on Saturday lunchtime. It was reigning champion Burgess who launched the perfect start from the second row on the grid to take the early race lead into Redgate. However, pole-man Smith took over the top spot after finding a way past the defending champ in a move that started at Redgate and ended at the Old Hairpin on lap six. </p>\n\n<p>Following a storming start from sixth on the grid, Jack Manchester headed the early battle for third from Harry Cockill and John Macleod. However, his potential podium hopes were dashed after a spin on the safety car restart led to retirement. </p>\n\n<p>Despite losing his advantage under the full course yellow to retrieve the stricken car of Shahin Nouri, Smith remained unchallenged to take the first spoils of the year. Oliver Barker, who recovered after dropping back to sixth from his front-row start, and Burgess rounded out the podium.</p>\n\n<p>Tony Barwell took the first Team Challenge win for RAW Motorsport in 16th place overall, ahead of Peter Tyler just behind for Nielsen. </p>\n\n<p>Bradley Smith followed up his opening race victory with a lights-to-flag win in round two. Smith had a comfortable drive to the top step of the podium as Harry Cockill and Steve Burgess battled hard for the honours of which step they would finish on throughout the closing stages of the 20-minute race. Cockill eventually came out on top after he and Burgess went side-by-side on the run into the final chicane on the penultimate lap. </p>\n\n<p>Behind the leading trio, Jack Lang took fourth as Tom Harvey secured the Team honours with fifth overall. Racing returnee Dominik Jackson fended off a challenge from his team-mate Marcello Marateotto to bag sixth place.</p>\n\n<p>Double race victor, Bradley Smith commented: “I’m really happy with the weekend. Obviously it was disappointing not to finish race three, but the car felt good and strong up until the mechanical failure and the first two races were exactly what I needed to start the season. I don’t think we’ll be out at Spa, but we will be back at Silverstone where Mectech Motorsport hopes to run a four-car team.”</p>\n\n<p>The results from the third and final race of the day, the 40-minute mandatory pitstop event, are subject to further investigation and will be released on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>For full Donington Park race results visit <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com\">www.tsl-timing.com</a></p>"

          "content": "<p>Returning to the grid after sitting out the Spa-Francorchamps rounds last month, Smith opened his weekend with a convincing third pole position of his 2017 Radical Challenge season, his best lap of 2:03.509 conquering the 32-car field by 0.853 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Series debutant, Danny Keirle topped the fight for the final front-row slot as just over one second covered the next eight cars. Current championship leader, Jack Lang clocked in third, 0.182 seconds ahead of Oliver Barker, who snatched fourth by a mere 0.066 seconds from SR1 Cup graduate Richard Baxter. Defending Challenge Champion, Steve Burgess, was sixth fastest 0.078 ahead of Team Challenge championship leaders and Silverstone class pole-sitters, Brian and Tom Harvey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 1 / Round 7</strong></p>\n\n<p>Carrying his unabated pace into the first 20-minute race of the weekend, Smith took a dominating lights-to-flag victory to secure his third win of the season while thrilling race-long battles unfolded for the remaining rostrum places behind him.</p>\n\n<p>Following superb second-row starts from both Lang and Barker, no more than 0.5 of a second separated the pair until the closing stages, Barker taking every opportunity to attack while Lang mounted an excellent defence. An equally close battle unfolded for fourth with newcomer Keirle applying constant pressure to teammate Burgess, with Keirle finding a way past on lap four.</p>\n\n<p>The new RAW Motorsport charge then chipped away at the 3.7 second gap to catch the fight for second with five minutes to go, forcing Barker to turn from attack to defence right up to the flag. The order, however, remained unchanged and Smith, Lang and Barker completed the round seven podium. Despite Baxter’s determined intentions, Burgess kept the Nielsen Racing car at bay to take fifth by 0.4 of a second, while Aaron and Lee Bailey took the first Team Challenge spoils of the weekend, a sterling drive from 13th on the grid rewarded with ninth overall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 2 / Round 8</strong></p>\n\n<p>Smith doubled-up for round eight on Sunday morning, leading from the lights for the second 20-minute showdown. Lang, Keirle and Barker gave chase, while Burgess got a fourth-row flyer to slot into fifth. Continuing his impressive Radical SR3 debut, Keirle began to apply pressure to current championship leader, Lang, before making his move heading on to the Hangar Straight on lap four. The 2016 Kartmasters Champion continued his charge to try and make in-roads into Smith’s 3.4 second lead, setting the fastest lap race in the process, but the experienced Mectech Motorsport man punched up the pace to remain un-headed to the flag.</p>\n\n<p>With Keirle clear in second, Barker and Lang looked set to repeat Saturday’s thrilling race one dog-fight. A mechanical issue, however, pitched Lang off into the gravel at Becketts on the penultimate tour, leaving Barker to romp home to his second third-place podium of the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>RAW Motorsport’s Burgess continued his faultless points-scoring run to finish fourth, while Dominik Jackson kept Jack Manchester at bay for fifth and sixth respectively. Stuart Maloney and Sean Byrne continued to vie side-by-side right up until the flag, just 0.017 seconds separating the pair across the line.</p>\n\n<p>Tom and Brian Harvey brought home their RAW Motorsport Radical SR3 home for Team Challenge honours 10th overall, two places up on their sixth-row start.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 3 / Round 9</strong></p>\n\n<p>The bumper Radical SR3 field got clean away for the 40-minute feature race rolling start. Smith took the early race lead from Keirle, Barker and Lang with the top four running nose-to-tail until the leading trio broke free from the pack on lap three, 1.6 seconds between them. Although Smith began to edge an advantage on lap five, Keirle and Barker continued to battle at close quarters right up until the pitstop window.</p>\n\n<p>Behind the fight for the podium places, Burgess and Manchester delivered a ding-dong fight for sixth, the Scorpio Motorsport charge allowing the coveted champ no more than a few tenths of a second breathing space but was unable to find a way past. A combined 15 second penalty for exceeding track limits, however, would put Burgess out of contention to finish 10th.</p>\n\n<p>With no success seconds added to the standard 45 second mandatory pitstop, Smith had a clean service and run home to the flag. Drama unfolded behind him, though, with Keirle forced to retire from a sterling second place and debut race weekend on lap 14, allowing Barker to take a step up the rostrum and complete a podium hat-trick.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing a stellar drive from eighth on the grid, Jackson leapfrogged Lang in the pitstop cycle to claim the final podium place. Maloney secured fifth on his first Radical Challenge outing while Kristian Jeffrey recorded his best result of the season so far in sixth.</p>\n\n<p>Peter Tyler and Tom Gladdis delivered a brilliant performance to turn 24th on the grid into their first Team Challenge win of the year, 11th overall, with Tom and Brian Harvey 14th and second in class, Paul Allen and Jason Redding third.</p>\n\n<p>Bradley Smith: “It’s been a perfect weekend. The team has done a fantastic job, they’ve given me a brilliant car to race, so a lot of thanks to them. It’s just been great. Looking ahead to Rockingham, we were strong there last year and I think we’ll have good pace, but the other guys are all pushing so I think it’ll be a tight weekend.”</p>\n\n<p>Oliver Barker: “It was a brilliant race. I knew it was critical to get a good start, fortunately I managed to do that. I knew I had extra success time during the pitstop but I didn’t know where I was in the order, so I just kept pushing as hard as I could. Then I got the call we were on the final lap and I was over the moon, so pleased.”</p>\n\n<p>Dominik Jackson: “I got a very good start and managed to convert that into two very good laps and then just settled in. It was about being consistent as the track was definitely slower in the last two races, so it was a case of putting the times in. Obviously it’s the most important race with double points so it’s good to be on the podium for this one.”</p>\n\n<p>The Radical Challenge field of 2017 travels 41 miles to the north-east of the county to Corby to continue the fourth stage championship battles at Rockingham next weekend.</p>\n\n<p>For full results visit <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com/\">www.tsl-timing.com</a></p>"

          "content": "<p>While the title battle may be done and dusted, with the dominant Shane Stoney (Quattro Motorsport) putting the crown out of reach of his rivals last time out at Donington Park, the bumper entry means there’s still much to enjoy about the packed field of 182bhp SR1s.</p>\n\n<p>Stoney has indeed been the class of the field all season, winning all but one of the races so far, and he’s out to try and cap his incredible campaign with yet more silverware, but there’s a host of talent determined to make one final charge in an effort to stop him.</p>\n\n<p>Potentially best placed to depose Stoney is 2018 SR1 Cup Champion James Pinkerton (JP Motorsport), who makes a welcome return to the grid this weekend. Pinkerton pushed Stoney hard across the first two rounds of 2019 before focusing on other interests, but he’s back for the season finale and ready to make his mark.</p>\n\n<p>There’s also a tense battle for second and third in the championship, with Chris Short (Works), Matt Jones (Privateer), Will Hunt (Scorpio Motorsport) and Ross Elliott (Avidity) all in contention.</p>\n\n<p>Short has been in scintillating form recently, having featured on the podium in each of the last three races, bringing his tally of rostrum appearances for the year to six. Jones has been ever-present in the top five, and has therefore scored well in every race so far this term, while Elliott has really clicked with his SR1 in recent rounds, having secured a front-row start and back-to-back podium finishes last time out at Donington. In contrast, Hunt has struggled in recent races, but still has the potential to mix it at the front, so cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>Others to watch include Dean Warriner (Track Focused), Mackenzie Walker (Matthew Bentley Racing), Gavin McAlpine (RAW Motorsports) and newcomer Martyn Astley (University of Derby).</p>\n\n<p>There are also the class battles to settle. Short’s efforts this term have helped him into the lead of the Fangio Trophy class – for drivers aged 40 and over – and he holds a healthy 20-point lead over Jones in that division. Things went south for Julian Lay (RAW) – the year’s only other outright race winner, alongside Stoney – with two retirements at Donington, which have left him trailing in third.</p>\n\n<p>Short says he needs to be fully on form to ensure he gets it over the line in the class fight. “I’m really looking forward to Snetterton, but I’m fully aware that I can’t afford a slip-up at this stage of the season,” he says. “Look at what happened to Julian at Donington, bad results can happen to anyone and change a season on its head, so I’ll need full focus to get the job done as Matt has been really quick and very consistent all year.</p>\n\n<p>“I’m loving driving the SR1 at the moment. I’m more comfortable than I’ve ever been in the car and my confidence is up, and I think working with the Radical Works team has been a huge part of that. Last time at Snetterton I went from 11th to second, so I need another one of those performances as I want to be on the podium – second or even better!”</p>\n\n<p>The Rookie Cup for novice drivers is also still up for grabs, with Mark Tranter (Privateer) leading from Simon Bailey (Track Focused). Andy Lowe (Works) joined the field at the last round and showed well, and we welcome DriveTribe’s Mike Fernie (Works) to the grid this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Despite sitting at the top of the Rookie Cup points, Tranter adds that he’s not feeling the pressure of being on the verge of securing a class crown in his first season.</p>\n\n<p>“I just need to focus on the finish, and that’s&nbsp;the main thing as I have the points cushion to protect me,” says Tranter. “But Snetterton is a tough track, with a very long and technical lap and it’s safe to say that I’ve not quite mastered it yet. You can easily lose a second on each straight if you don’t maximise your corner exit speed. But to be close to a title in my first year is amazing. It’s been a brilliant year and I’ve learned so much, yet still have so much more to learn. I’ve worked with RAW Motorsports on setup in recent rounds and found some time, so hopefully that partnership can pay off again this weekend.”</p>\n\n<p>Qualifying for the final round of the Radical SR1 Cup is scheduled for 09:25 on Saturday, October 19, with the first race set to get underway at 11:40, followed by the final race of the year at 15:25.

A dominant fight back from Dominik Jackson to chalk up win number four in the third and final endurance battle, however, means Burgess provisionally leads the title fight by just two points heading into the second half of the season."

          "content": "<p><strong>Race 1:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following Jackson’s clean sweep at Spa last time out, Nottingham man Burgess made clear his intentions to claw back the top spot from the off, converting pole position into his sixth win of the season. The RAW Motorsports man didn’t have it all his own way as teammate Jackson, who had led the standings heading into the fourth round, snatched the early race lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Running side by side from the rolling start and all the way round to Cascades, Jackson got the upper hand and streaked ahead in an effort to negate his maximum success second penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Despite a blistering opening stint and pulling out a 5.2 second lead ahead of the pit stops, a spin at Cascades on his out lap cost Jackson dear. Re-joining down in 10th with it all to do, he managed to catch and pass Marcello Marateotto to finish eighth and pick up two further points for the fastest race lap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The only top title protagonist without a penalty to serve, Burgess streaked comfortably ahead while two new faces for 2018 completed the podium. Mark Richards finished second, capping his best performance since Spa last year, whilst Brian Murphy made his first visit to the Radical rostrum with a fantastic third from sixth on the grid.</p>\n\n<p>The fierce fight for fourth saw the youngest driver of the field, Elliot Goodman hold off race-long pressure right up until the penultimate tour when Jérôme de Sadeleer found a way through. Although Kristian Jeffrey initially followed suit, a run wide at Old Hall allowed Goodman to battle back to finish fifth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Burgess made it two from two in the second battle of the day, but only just!</p>\n\n<p>The 20-minute sprint race delivered a good dose of drama from the outset, with Burgess and arch rival Jackson once again battling wheel-to-wheel from the lights. Although it was Burgess that this time emerged from Old Hall with the lead, Jackson was rarely more than one second from his rear wing.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson went for the lead with an ambitious move heading towards Hislops on lap nine. Although passing Burgess on the road, both drivers took avoiding action, with Jackson taking to the grass while Burgess utilised the escape road. What could have been a five minute thrash to the flag was thwarted due to a red flag stoppage, caused by the stricken car of Italian Marcello Marateotto. With the results counted back to the previous tour, Burgess remained victor.</p>\n\n<p>The red flag also denied a thrilling three-way battle for third, with Richards staving off the determined Jeffrey and charging de Sadeleer to take his second podium of&nbsp;the weekend. Brian Caudwell delivered another fine drive to complete the top six.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 3:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The tables turned again for the final 40-minute pit stop race, with Jackson returning to the fore. Getting the jump at the rolling start secured the lead into turn one and, with no pit stop penalty to serve, the Lincoln ace remained un-headed in a dominant run to the chequered flag.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst Jackson streaked off into the distance with Guyana’s Jeffrey giving chase, Burgess found himself under fire in third. Although he and de Sadeleer traded paint exiting Old Hall for the second time, Burgess held sway ahead of the pitstops but a full success penalty from race one was always going to make another podium a big ask. Further time lost and a spin on lap 16 meant he had to fight back to bag points for a commendable sixth.</p>\n\n<p>With the stops complete, the top three of Jackson, Jeffrey and de Sadeleer enjoyed an un-hassled run to the rostrum. Mark Crader overcame what was initially a six car fight for fifth from 12th on the grid, followed home by the ever consistent Goodman, who equally can only be races away from a top three finish.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Peter Tyler and Tom Gladdis delivered a perfect weekend with a trio of Team Challenge wins to cement their class lead heading into the summer break. The Radical Challenge championship battle will resume at Snetterton, 11-12 August.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver quotes:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Steve Burgess (Winner race one &amp; two):</strong> “It was close between me and Dominik at the start of race one through turn one, but I let him go as there was no point in tangling and I knew he had the 20 second penalty to serve.&nbsp;I got a flying start in race two and we went wheel to wheel in the first part of the lap, I pulled about a second gap but then I made a few mistakes and he stuck it up the inside and I had nowhere to go but straight. I was quite relieved for the red flag to come out to be honest!”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominik Jackson (Second race two, winner race three):</strong> “It was a shame that race two was red-flagged. I thought I had a little bit of pace on him [Burgess] towards the end which gave me the opportunity to have a go, which went wrong for both of us! It was nice to make amends for race one with the win in race three. Steve fell into the pack a little bit at the start and I was able to make a break and pull away.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mark Richards (Second race one, third race three):</strong> “It's great to be back on the podium. I settled into a rhythm at the start of race one as I knew I didn't have a success penalty to serve so it wasn't worth taking any big risks. I came out of the pits in clean air and didn't have to push too hard. Race two was tough, I was lucky that Jerome got a bad start and I got a good one so had a bit of a gap. The red flag at the end was my friend, though.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brian Harvey (Third race one):</strong> “It's taken me a while to get here, but I'm really pleased. I lucked into getting in front of Elliot [Goodman]. He then got into a battle and dropped away and it gave me the chance to chase after Mark. I thought as long as I could keep a gap to the guys behind me then I knew I should be okay.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kristian Jeffrey (Second race three):</strong> “It was a good result, it's the first time I've raced here at Oulton Park. In practice the track felt like a maze! We made changes after each of the races and I felt more comfortable with the car and P2 is a great result.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jérôme De Sadeleer (Third race three): </strong>“Oulton Park is a very special place, it's a historic track. It's quick, narrow and very unforgiving, so getting a podium is great. Kristian was fast this weekend and we've been trading places at each round, it's great to have someone to fight with. We're still technically in contention for the title, but it's becoming more difficult.”</p>\n\n<p>For full results and timing visit <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.tsl-timing.com</a></p>"

          "content": "<p>Reigning champion James Lay started the Silverstone weekend as favourite but was on the back foot from the start, failing to complete the lap in qualifying. “I got as far as Stowe and the drive unit failed,” he explained.</p>\n\n<p>DW Racing’s Ben Caisley therefore secured pole, closely followed by ex F2 and F3 racer Hector Hurst on his debut with Scorpio, and Valour’s Chris Preen.</p>\n\n<p>Preen’s challenge lasted until the first corner, where there was contact from behind with DW’s Andy Lowe. As Preen spun he also had contact with DW’s Peter Tyler, while RAW’s Alim Geshev took to the gravel to avoid contact.</p>\n\n<p>With the safety car out Caisley led from Hurst, 360’s Jason Rishover, Doris’s Mark Williams and Valour’s Haydn Chance, with Lay already up to sixth.</p>\n\n<p>The green flag was waved as they started lap three, but Rishover lost out. “I just lost grip at the restart and they came by,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Both Williams and Lay had gone by, “Jason hesitated through Maggotts and I got him onto Hanger Straight, then went side by side with Lay through Stowe,” Williams explained.</p>\n\n<p>Caisley’s lead had grown, but Lay started to reel in second placed Hurst, while Williams and Rishover both consolidated, as Chance and Doris’s John MacLeod duelled for sixth.</p>\n\n<p>Lay took Hurst into the Loop after four laps, but on lap eight Caisley suddenly slowed, “the actuator had gone and the gears wouldn’t engage,” he explained after heading pitwards.</p>\n\n<p>Lay had the lead but after only one more lap the race was red flagged, with Austin Riley in the gravel at Maggotts.</p>\n\n<p>From the back of the grid to victory by well over four seconds, Lay had dominated. “I had to take the inside at Woodcote to avoid the start incident, then followed Mark through. I thought maybe top five to be honest, so really pleased,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Hurst was delighted with second in only his second race in nine years. “I tried to get Ben before the safety car, but when James closed in I let him go,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Equally delighted with his third place was Williams, “I did think about trying to follow James after he got by, but I wanted to see the chequered flag, as it equalled my best result,” he explained.</p>\n\n<p>Rishover retained fourth, but had MacLeod closing at the end, while Chance just held off TGR’s Jack Tomalin to complete the top six.</p>\n\n<p>Lay and Caisley soon went clear in Sunday morning’s second race, while Hurst led a six-car train for third, from Tomalin, MacLeod, Rishover, Williams and Chance.</p>\n\n<p>Into Brooklands on lap three, Tomalin was pressing for third, but his challenge, cost him a place a lap later as MacLeod got by.</p>\n\n<p>After a brief safety car intervention, there were 13 minutes on the clock as the green flag came out, but for Tomalin it was race over. “It was a hectic restart and we were three abreast through Maggots. Chance spun and I had nowhere to go,” he explained as both cars were out.</p>\n\n<p>It was comfortable win for Lay, as Caisley lost out at the restart, with an SR1 between them. “Quite straight forward,” said Lay. “Frustrating for me. Mark had a go at me from the restart, but I thought no way, but James got the break again,” Caisley added.</p>\n\n<p>Williams was both surprised and delighted to be in third again, “the SR1 between us bunched it all up at the restart and I actually got a run on Ben. But we both went for the inside at Maggotts and avoided the contact and I was into third,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Hurst had also lost out at the restart but retained fourth, as both he and Tyler were threateningly close to Williams again at the flag, with Geshev completing the top six.</p>\n\n<p>It was light rain for the final race of the weekend, but it soon got heavier after they went for a safety car start.</p>\n\n<p>Lay led but Caisley was on the attack as soon as the race went live, sharing a couple of exchanges as Hurst looked on, from MacLeod, Preen and Rishover.</p>\n\n<p>Lay was down to third, just before Caisley was first to make his stop, which left Hurst out in front. Preen was third, but 360’s Rishover and Jacek Zielonka both pitted from fourth and fifth after five laps, with Hurst, Lay and Preen following a lap later.</p>\n\n<p>Once the stops were complete Preen was out in front, with Lay leading the chase, from Hurst, Zielonka, Caisley and MacLeod.</p>\n\n<p>Conditions were making it difficult for any progress to be made. “I could see James in my mirrors, he was quick under braking but I didn’t really feel any pressure,” said Preen, after taking his first Radical win in the UK by 1.326 secs.</p>\n\n<p>“The grip was on the edge, but I had a few sideways moments. Happy with that but it would have been nice to win,” Lay added.</p>\n\n<p>Hurst held onto third, with Caisley taking Zielonka for fourth on the last lap. “It was really good in the wet, I could see Ben coming and then I made a mistake at Maggotts,” Zielonka explained.</p>\n\n<p>“The success pitstop penalty did it for me,” said Caisley, who then received a pitlane speeding penalty too, dropping him to ninth, which left MacLeod and Chance to round off the top six.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Radical Cup UK - SR1</h2>\n\n<p>Championship leader Theo Micouris dominated the opening race of the weekend for RAW/Hart GT, with James Pinkerton and Derby University’s Tom Wood holding station in second and third throughout.</p>\n\n<p>“I was caught up with an SR3 though for a while and had to let him by as it was getting stressful, “said Micouris.</p>\n\n<p>Both Doris’s Shane Stoney and DW’s Oscar Joyce were delayed at the start, as their start caught the end of the SR3 incident.</p>\n\n<p>Stoney soon had fourth sewn up, while Joyce retained fifth from Track Focused’s George Knutton. “I started well and then found an SR3 across the track. After a bad restart Theo was gone and I had oversteer and understeer in the same corner,” Stoney added.</p>\n\n<p>Initially Micouris had the race two lead, but it didn’t last long. “I couldn’t change down into Club Corner and was stuck in fifth gear, so I just did what I could to get a finish.</p>\n\n<p>Stoney had the lead from lap three, after an early duel with Wood, but was shadowed by Pinkerton in the works car, after his duel with Wood ended. “The front upright broke,” said Wood, after he went off at Luffield and brought out the safety car.</p>\n\n<p>“That was lot’s better, I had to control the gap at the restart, as I didn’t want to be held up by any SR3’s,” Stoney explained.</p>\n\n<p>Third place went down to the wire, George Knutton had managed to hold off Valour’s James Ockenden until the last lap.</p>\n\n<p>“Onto the Vale I went up on George’s inside, I had tried at Brooklands but had to lean on it too much,” said Ockenden. North’s Ashley Gaunt and DW’s Sven Thompson had both gone through, before Knutton recovered to complete the top six.</p>\n\n<p>Stoney finished third on the road after another duel with Wood, in a very wet finale, after Ockenden and George Knutton had taken their duel for the lead to the flag.</p>\n\n<p>“I had the lead, but it was hard work, then George got me when I made a mistake,” admitted Ockenden. Knutton was first over the line, but he had missed his pitstop window, dropping him to last place.</p>\n\n<p>But Ockenden had also picked up a penalty for a short stop, which handed Stoney the win. “I was challenging Tom and he went wide at the Vale, I got down the inside but there was a touch,” said Stoney, after it proved to be the decisive move on the last lap.</p>\n\n<p>Micouris was classified third after a last lap exchange with Valour’s Kristian Brookes too. “That was fun starting at the back and with a 20 secs pitstop penalty. I had a touch with Kristian at Luffield and we were almost side by side over the line,” he explained.</p>\n\n<p>Wood recovered in fourth with Ockenden dropping to fifth and Joyce rounding off the top six.</p>"

All of our races were completed in front of thousands of spectators as we showed the Radical Cup program to a new audience here in Canada.”</p>\n\n<p>While Jon Field entered the day with the hopes of sweeping the weekend in the Platinum class, it was Louis Schriber who ended the third and final race of the weekend on top. Wayne Williams had a career weekend in Radical Cup competition adding to his podium result and pole position on Saturday with another podium finish, this time in the second position as Field crossed the line third for first, first and third in his three-wheel-to-wheel races. “Indy Al” Miller, who took the lead at the start, was able to come home in the fourth position ahead of Kevin Poitras in P5.</p>\n\n<p>It was the Danny Dyszelski and Nick Persing show again in the Pro 1500 class as the championship combatants finished first and second again with Dyszelski leading the way. Canadian Austin Riley took the lead on the opening lap but was unable to keep the WISKO Racing and Radical Northwest competitors behind him, although he did secure his second podium result of the weekend. Dyszelski scored the win with Persing and Riley celebrating on the podium with him. RySpec Racing put a pair of drivers inside the top five as Robert Soroka finished just behind Riley with race two winner on the weekend Gregg Gorski finishing fifth. Danny Dyszelski was also awarded the race three Hard Charger Award.</p>\n\n<p>Robert Cipriani-Detres added his second win of the weekend as he climbed to the top step of the podium for Team Stradale putting on another show in the Pro 1340 class. Ken Savage, the first race winner on the weekend, found his way back to the podium, this time in the second position as Jace Bacon added another podium result to his resume. Huw Leahy crossed the line fourth, just shy of the podium as Seth Bacon was classified in the fifth position.</p>\n\n<p>“This weekend also showcased FEL’s Emzone Radical Cup Canada series and the Blue Marble Radical Cup at one of Canada’s most prestigious events, and wow, did they put on a show,” said Drewer. “And once again Radical has allowed its customers to tick off yet another bucket list experience.”</p>\n\n<p>Next up for the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America program is a trip to Austin, Texas, and Circuit of The Americas in late August. Follow the Blue Marble Radical Cup social media pages for news, information, photos, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Marble Radical Cup events are open to all local and regional Radical racers with eligible cars to participate.</p>"

          "content": "<p>The RAW Motorsports duo share all but one victory between them so far. Burgess holds the upper hand with seven wins to his credit but, since round three at Spa, Jackson has snatched four dominant victories from his teammate’s grasp.</p>\n\n<p>A clean sweep in Belgium gave Jackson the advantage heading into the previous Oulton Park round, but a brake issue and race one spin left him salvaging points for eighth while Burgess took win number six.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A late red flag towards the end of race two brought a premature conclusion to that epic tussle, leaving the former champ to double-up before the tables turned again. Race three and Jackson returned to the fore for the fourth time while a spin and full pit stop success penalty&nbsp; left Burgess sixth.</p>\n\n<p>So, with more of the same all but guaranteed for the rest of the season, who can get the jump at Snetterton? On paper, the 2016 title holder may have the benefit of experience and previous winner’s glory but Jackson can already lay claim to four from six podiums there last year, his series debut season.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Snetterton is a strong circuit for me, so I hope to have the edge this weekend,” says Burgess. “This time, Dom will have the maximum success penalty for the first race, so I doubt we’ll be racing to the flag. But that situation could well be in reverse come race three! There’s nothing to choose between us, so the pit stop penalties will play a big factor in the final half of the season.”</p>\n\n<p>“With the vast points range on offer, 80 points for each endurance and 40 points for a sprint win, the current difference is insignificant,” says Jackson. “We were a bit unfortunate with a brake issue taking us out of the race one lead at Oulton, so I’m hoping to get back to the top of the table.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“I feel like I’m in a better place for Snetterton this year, I know the circuit much better than I did Spa or Oulton. For me the key will be maximising my race one result whilst carrying the last round success penalty. It’ll be all about getting ahead at the start, pushing to build up a gap to negate the penalty and ensure a place on the podium. It should be fun!”</p>\n\n<p>The other race winner so far this season, Jerôme de Sadeleer is locked in battle with Kristian Jeffrey for third with just 33 points separating the pair. Snetterton is a strong circuit for both drivers; it’s where de Sadeleer sealed his SR1 Cup crown while Jeffrey is a multiple podium finisher at the Norfolk track. Both are fully capable of upsetting the status quo.</p>\n\n<p>Standout performances from Mark Richards and Brian Murphy saw two new visitors to the Radical rostrum at Oulton Park. Mark Crader and Marcello Marateotto can also be counted among the podium finishers this term, while Elliott Goodman edges ever closer to ranking in the top three.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Add to that Brian Caudwell, Challenge returnees Richard Baxter and Jason Rishover, plus Solo class entry switches for John Caudwell and Peter Tyler, and the midfield fight promises to be as equally fierce.</p>\n\n<p>It’s back to a two-day programme of Radical action at Snetterton, with qualifying set to start at 09:00 followed by the first 40-minute endurance with compulsory pit stop at 13.20. Racing resumes on Sunday with the 20-minute sprint race taking place at 11:10 ahead of the final endurance battle at 16:00.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Follow the blow-by-blow action on the official Radical Sportscars social media channels.

          "content": "<p><strong>Race 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Burgess opened his 2018 account with a stellar win from pole position in challenging conditions, as sunny skies gave way to heavy rain, turning the compulsory pit stops into a tyre gamble.</p>\n\n<p>The local racer led from the&nbsp;start of the first 40-minute race of the season but Dominik Jackson was with him all the way, even getting the jump on the former Champ through the pit stops to briefly emerge as race leader before Burgess battled back.</p>\n\n<p>Despite both drivers opting to remain on slicks while the majority of the 25-car field changed to wets, a 27-second advantage over third-placed Kristian Jeffrey ensured the leading duo remained unchallenged.</p>\n\n<p>The fierce fight for third was initially led by de Sadeleer, who kept an insistent Kristian Jeffrey at bay until a spin dropped the Guyanese driver down to eighth. A superb recovery drive and pit stop, however, saw Jeffrey jump back up the order.</p>\n\n<p>Recovering from a slow stop, de Sadeleer set a blistering pace running on wets and looked promising to challenge Marcello Marateotto for fourth. A red flag stoppage with four minutes to go, due to a spun John Caudwell at Coppice, curtailed his plans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Adrian and Joe Watt took the first Team class spoils of the season following a storming drive from the back of the grid to 12th overall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Burgess doubled-up with pole-to-flag win number two in the 20-minute sprint race on Sunday morning. Another superb start ensured the 2016 Champ romped clear from the lights ahead of a short safety car period on lap three, before the RAW Motorsports driver built up a comfortable lead by way of setting consecutive fastest laps heading to the flag.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, a slow front row getaway from Jackson sparked a squabble for second from which Mark Richards emerged behind Burgess, followed by Jackson, de Sadeleer and Jeffrey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Once clear of the full course caution, Jackson made his move on Richards for second, whilst de Sadeleer and Jeffrey battled at close quarters for fourth. The Swiss driver was able to push on and pass Richards for the final place on the podium, damage to Jeffrey’s car dropped him down the order.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the consistent efforts of Brian Caudwell, on a blistering charge from 12th on the grid, Richards held on to bag points for fourth with Richard Baxter completing the top six.</p>\n\n<p>Although John Caudwell initially led the Team class battle, a spin on lap 11 allowed Joe Watt to take the win from Peter Tyler.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Clean away for the final 40-minute endurance race of the weekend, pole sitter Burgess briefly led the field from de Sadeleer, Jackson and Richards before back-to-back safety car periods absorbed the first 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Back to green flag racing just eight minutes ahead of the pit stop window, Burgess&nbsp;plan to put the hammer down and pull out a big enough gap to negate his maximum success seconds penalty was no longer possible. But the local Nottingham&nbsp;man still gave his all to post continuous fastest laps as he built up a 4.6 second lead before pitting. With Burgess, de Sadeleer and Jackson all serving success penalties, all eyes were on penalty-free Richards who inevitably led the pack with the stops complete.</p>\n\n<p>Richards’ lead was short lived due to a pit stop infringement which necessitated a stop/go penalty, dropping him down the order, gifting de Sadeleer a clear run and six-second buffer to Burgess with only two minutes remaining. Jackson, who stayed within 0.7 seconds of Burgess continued his consistent podium form to secure third.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Crader was only one place off equalling his career best finish, ranking fourth ahead of Elliot Goodman. A determined Kristian Jeffrey rounded out the top six after a stellar charge from 19th on the grid and race-long battles with Barry Liversidge and Brian Harvey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>John Caudwell and Stuart Moseley took Team class honours, a just reward after a roller-coaster weekend for the Nielsen car.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver quotes:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jerome De Sadeleer (Winner race three):</strong> “I'm so glad to be on the top step. I came into the weekend not knowing where I'd be. I finished around mid-pack when I did the final race last year, so finishing this race in first place gives me confidence heading to Brands Hatch.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Steve Burgess (Winner races one and two):</strong> “I couldn’t ask for a better start to the season with two wins in the first two races. I'm over the moon with second in race three. With the safety cars at the start I didn't think there was going to be any chance to be this far up. I had no idea where I was when I came back out after the stop, I just had to drive flat out for the final 20 minutes.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominik Jackson (Second races one and two, third race three):</strong> “It was a shame that the first half of race three was ruined for Steve and I with the safety car&nbsp;periods as it meant&nbsp;we didn't have an opportunity to build up a gap, but I'm happy to take a clean sweep of podiums at the end of the day.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kristian Jeffrey (Third race one):</strong> “We really got lucky in race one. In the dry we were P4 and while trying to catch Jerome I spun and dropped down to eighth. I recovered in the wet to get back to third. The conditions were very tricky and I opted to go for wets at the pit stop. It was a rollercoaster ride and we were lucky to come away with P3.”</p>\n\n<p>For full race results visit <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.tsl-timing.com</a></p>"

          "content": "<p><strong>Race 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Burgess began his winning ways with a satisfying third victory of his 2018 campaign on Saturday afternoon, in a race which saw nothing to choose between the top three championship protagonists.</p>\n\n<p>Although Burgess led from pole, Jackson and Jérôme de Sadeleer refused to allow the 2016 Champion to gain any advantage, with the trio running equidistant just a few tenths of a second apart for much of the shortened 20-minute race. As the leading three pulled clear of the pack, the order remained unchanged until the final corner of the final lap when, in an attempt to secure second at the flag, de Sadeleer ran wide and ended his race in the Clearways tyre wall.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing his strong qualifying performance, Marcello Marateotto led the fight for fourth, leaving him perfectly placed to pick up the final podium position. Brian Murphy and Kristian Jeffrey vied for fifth place, Jeffries eventually making a stellar move stick at Surtees on lap five.</p>\n\n<p>With fierce battles up and down the 20-car field, Elliot Goodman pulled off a superb pass on Spencer Bourne into Paddock Hill Bend to take sixth with five minutes remaining. Behind them, a six-car battle for ninth came to a head at Druids on the penultimate tour, resulting in John Caudwell losing the Team class lead to Peter Tyler.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jackson was denied his maiden Radical Challenge win on Sunday morning, despite leading from lights to flag. The RAW Motorsports charge was judged to have jumped the start, the resulting 10 second penalty dropping him to third, leaving Burgess to pick up win number two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Whilst Jackson romped away at the lights, Burgess didn’t get the best of starts leaving the championship leader with it all to do heading into Paddock Hill Bend. Securing second, a jostling pack behind saw de Sadeleer take to the gravel but able to re-join at the back of the field. John Caudwell wasn’t so fortunate and with Brian Caudwell’s car beached across the inside kerb at Druids, an early safety car was required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Clean away at the restart with 14 minutes remaining, Jackson led from Burgess and Marateotto. Unaware of Jackson’s impending penalty, Burgess was relentless in the pursuit of his teammate and threatened to send it up the inside on more than one occasion, but Jackson remained undeterred.</p>\n\n<p>Marateotto crossed the line third on-track but moved up to the second step of the podium ahead of Jackson. Jeffrey, making his GP circuit debut, finished fourth despite also jumping the start. Brian Murphy mirrored his race one result to pick up points for fifth ahead of Spencer Bourne.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Starting from pole for the final 40-minute endurance race, Jackson threatened to once again spoil Burgess’ party. Running side-by-side from the rolling start and down the Brabham Straight, Jackson managed to seize the initiative at Paddock Hill Bend but Burgess remained glued to his rear bumper throughout the opening stint.</p>\n\n<p>The gap ebbed and flowed as Burgess overheated his tyres and had to drop back and re-group before attacking once more, but&nbsp;an off-track moment&nbsp;from Jackson at Stirlings on lap 12 was all the invitation Burgess needed to surge through. Although Jackson recovered well, a lengthy pit stop meant Burgess sailed clear to the flag whilst Jackson took important points for fourth.</p>\n\n<p>With the leading duo setting a blistering pace from the off, the intense battle for third between Murphy, Brian Caudwell, de Sadeleer, Jeffrey and Richard Baxter ran right to the pitstops. Caudwell came out on top and pushed on to pass Baxter the following tour to secure second.</p>\n\n<p>Although Baxter finished third on the road, a penalty for speeding in the pit lane dropped him outside the top 10, gifting Jeffrey the final podium position.</p>\n\n<p>Goodman was once again on form to finish fifth, having started from 12th on the grid, while Barry Liversidge notched up his best result of the season so far in sixth.</p>\n\n<p>Peter Tyler and Tom Gladdis managed to complete a clean sweep of the top step of the team podium across the weekend, heading John Caudwell and Stuart Moseley in race three.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For full results visit <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.tsl-timing.com</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver quotes:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Steve Burgess (Winner all races):</strong>&nbsp;“That was a perfect weekend, pole and the three wins, it can't get much better, can it? I think I had the legs on Dom (Jackson) by a fraction but it's hard to pass here. I kept overheating the tyres following him too close so I kept backing off and going again and he then made a mistake out the back and I managed to get by.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Brian Caudwell (Second race three):&nbsp;</strong>“It was excellent, it's been a long time waiting. I've had a fairly tough year so far. I knew I was never going to win as Steve has a lot more pace on me, but I'm really happy. I look in the top ten now and there's guys finishing in ninth, tenth, eleventh and they're podium finishers. It's fiercely contested at the minute.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominik Jackson (Second race One, third race two):</strong>&nbsp;“There wasn't much in it during race one, we were all setting nearly identical times. It was a shame in race two as I was rolling slightly and got a penalty. But I still managed to take third with the penalty so it's not too bad considering.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kristian Jeffrey (Third race three):</strong>&nbsp;“It was a good weekend, considering I didn't have the pace of the front runners. I'm happy to come out top five in all three races. You guys should be happy the Caribbean bought the weather! The team really worked hard on the car making me more comfortable throughout the weekend. We got better and better each race but it just wasn't enough.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marcello Marateotto (Third race one, second race two):</strong>&nbsp;“At my age you have to be happy if they let you start and if you finish on the podium then it's an excellent weekend! I was able to watch the guys at the front fighting each other but I wasn't able to challenge. I've still got some work to do on the car and myself.”</p>"

          "content": "<p>The reigning Radical Challenge Champion proved his title-winning status with a faultless drive, working his way from ninth on the grid and up to fourth by lap four. Yet another gripping, wheel-to-wheel battle with fellow Challenge contender Barker ensued, but a run wide from Barker at the Bus Stop helped Burgess move up to third on lap eight.</p>\n\n<p>From there the RAW Motorsport driver held station until the pitstop window. Emerging as race leader, Burgess remained unchallenged to add an overall race win to his third-place race two podium earned earlier in the day.</p>\n\n<p>A deluge of rain 30-minutes before the third and final race of the weekend made for interesting conditions, forcing teams to make a late change to wet tyres whilst on the grid. As green flag racing got underway after two laps under the safety car, American racer Ryan Booth led John Harrison and Jeremy Ferguson at the restart, until Harrison took the advantage to head the field on lap four. With the two lead 2017 SR8s fighting upfront whilst Barker and Burgess jostled for third, Dominik Jackson, Jack Lang, Ferguson, Brian Harvey and Shahin Nouri battled it out for fifth.</p>\n\n<p>Harrison pitted early to switch to slicks and handover to Noble Jnr on lap nine, leaving Booth to lead Burgess and mount a final push before pitting three laps later. Barker held third and second in class ahead of Lang, Ferguson and James Robinson, up to fifth after starting from the back of the grid.</p>\n\n<p>With a dry line emerging, a race to perfectly time a switch to slicks unfolded. When the pitstop window closed, Burgess held a comfortable margin over Barker, with Lang completing the top three on the road and in the Challenge class.</p>\n\n<p>Jim Booth headed the invitational class battle amid a hectic gaggle of cars vying for fifth as Booth persevered, still on wet tyres. A stop-go refuelling penalty served with 10 minutes to go left Noble Jnr to take-up the European Masters lead.</p>\n\n<p>Save more than a few slippery moments, the top five of Burgess, Barker, Lang, Jackson and Noble Jnr remained unchanged, while Andrew Ferguson took Sean Byrne in the closing stages for sixth and a second-place Masters class podium.</p>\n\n<p>Finishing a superb eighth overall, Jack Manchester and Robinson took Team Challenge honours. Dragos Dumitrascu and Dominik Dierkes claimed second in class, 14th overall, with Aaron and Lee Bailey 16th and third in category.</p>\n\n<p>Burgess’ overall and Challenge race three spoils sealed a trio of different outright and Radical Festival class winners. James Robinson opened the special Spa-Francorchamps weekend with all-out and Team Challenge victory on Saturday afternoon, while Sunday morning saw the 2.7-litre SR8 reign supreme in the hands of John Harrison and Colin Noble Jnr, for European Masters honours.</p>\n\n<p>For full provisional race results click <a href=\"http://www.hazelpr.com/email_news/Radical_Sportscars/Radical_Festival_Race_3_Results.pdf\">here</a>.</p>"

Heading in to the final showdown, just 76 points separated the pair and with 210 points still up for grabs, the title fight remained wide open.</p>\n\n<p>Despite Nottingham-man Burgess re-igniting his title hopes with his ninth win this term on Saturday morning, the 2016 Champion was powerless to close the final gap due to no racing taking place at the circuit on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lincolnshire pole-sitter, Jackson led the way for race one with Burgess in hot pursuit, the title protagonists initially pulling clear of Jerôme de Sadeleer and Kristian Jeffrey in the tricky, wet conditions. But, as the surface water began to disperse, it was de Sadeleer that was on the move and past Burgess by lap four.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nA three-car fight between Marcello Marateotto, Jeffrey and Brian Caudwell unfolded for fourth, the latter outwitting both drivers and Burgess to sit third. Meanwhile, Jackson continued to edge out a 5.6 second lead in a bid to negate his 20-second success penalty carried over from his last round Rockingham win.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nWith de Sadeleer also serving an additional 10 success seconds, Burgess emerged from the pit lane in Jackson’s wheel tracks second overall on fresh slicks. His wet tyres destroyed, Jackson had no answer&nbsp;to&nbsp;his charging teammate, who moved into the lead come Luffield and never looked back.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nLosing up to nine seconds a lap as the only front runner still on wets, Jackson became a sitting duck. Falling behind both de Sadeleer and Caudwell, the 2017 Vice Champion was then pipped to fourth on the road by Jeffrey at the line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With Caudwell handed a post-race 60-second penalty in lieu of a stop/go infringement, Jackson was promoted to fourth. That left Spencer Bourne to deliver one of his best drives to fifth ahead of Brian Murphy, who charged through to sixth from 12th place following the pit stops.</p>\n\n<p>The weather&nbsp;put a further spanner in the works on Sunday morning, with prolonged torrential rain suspending all track activity before the meeting was abandoned at lunchtime.</p>\n\n<p>Outgoing Radical SR1 Champion, Jerôme de Sadeleer rounded off his maiden Challenge season ranking third overall, 44 points ahead of his closest year-long rival, Guyanese ace Kristian Jeffrey. Youngest driver of the field, Elliot Goodman finished an impressive fifth with Mark Crader completing the top six.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver quotes:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominik Jackson, 2018 Radical Challenge Champion:</strong> “Wow! I think consistency has been key for me this year. It's pretty crazy to be within ten points of each other all season long, especially when there's so many races. It's been fun for everyone. I've had no mechanical issues and I haven't binned it myself either. It's taken me longer to learn the car after being away from racing for so long, but it's all come together now. It's a bit of an anti-climax with the meeting being cancelled, but the team has been great all year, it's been a great season with RAW.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Steve Burgess: </strong>“It's been some of the closest and enjoyable racing of my career, to be honest. It would have been great to end it on a high, but it wasn't to be. For the championship fight to be so close, but then not be able to race due to weather when I had a chance of still winning is highly frustrating. That said, I agree with the decision to not race, it was the right call. The team has been great and done a great job all year.”<br>\n<strong>&nbsp;<br>\nJerôme de Sadeleer: </strong>“I'm very, very pleased. I think I've worked out I have a 50% podium finish ratio for this season. The last two races, I feel like I've got the car set-up better than ever and made a big jump in my abilities to come back stronger next year. I'm going to train hard over the winter with the aim to come back and win the title next season. I'm excited for next year, for sure.”</p>"

          "content": "<p>For the fifth year in succession, the Radical Australian Cup season kicked off at the Bathurst 12 Hour, but unlike past years, teams had just one combined practice/qualifying session to set the grid for the two 45-minute races, with race one classified by the fastest lap set in that session, race two’s grid coming from the second fastest lap - there were no second chances.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately reigning champion Paddon claimed pole position, but in part due to strategy, Paddon set a time just four tenths of a second slower than his outright lap record, on ‘old’ tyres he’d used during the final round of the 2017 season in New Zealand.</p>\n\n<p>What he hadn’t factored in though was the pace of RAC Bathurst rookie Chris Perini, the 2017 NSW SuperSport runner-up falling just nine tenths short of Paddon’s pole time, before pushing him all the way to the line in Friday’s opening race, in the process leading almost half the 18-lap race distance.</p>\n\n<p>Paddon wasn’t about to make the same mistake a second time, adopting a brand new set of the Dunlop control tyres for race two in an effort to use the extra grip to maximise his pace - he wasn’t messing around!</p>\n\n<p>Off the start Paddon moved across slightly to achieve a better entry to turn one, almost allowing Kim Burke to move through on Perini into turn one.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, for the second race in a row - and this time one corner earlier - Michael Whiting spun on the exit of turn one on cold tyres whilst comfortably sixth.. He had a big job ahead of him to recover!</p>\n\n<p>Up front Paddon was using every bit of his extensive Bathurst experience to gap the field on cold tyres, most drivers confirming that it was taking three to four laps to get their control Dunlops up to maximum operating temperature, so experience was key in the early laps.</p>\n\n<p>By lap four he was up by five seconds over the battle between Perini and Burke, with Burke pushing the new rookie hard having clearly found something to his liking with the setup of the car overnight.</p>\n\n<p>By lap seven though Paddon’s lead - which would have been good enough to see him make his compulsory pit stop [CPS] and rejoin ahead of Perini after new regulations for 2018 saw the top five drivers penalised an additional ‘compensation time’ during their CPS, Paddon facing a five second longer stop than his young rival - was negated with the appearance of a Safety Car for Peter White.</p>\n\n<p>As he had done in race one, 2015 outright Bathurst winner Peter White was running around comfortably inside the top five, battling long-time rival Nick Kelly for fourth when it all came unstuck on top of the mountain.</p>\n\n<p><em>“I ran just a tad wide at Skyline, rode the kerb then suddenly the car snapped left and took off into the wall,” </em>White admitted. <em>“I’d done the same thing yesterday [riding the kerb] and it was fine so I wasn’t concerned about using it, but I must have had a bit of steering angle and that was all it needed. It was a big knock to the car, but I’m okay,”</em> he explained afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>The field spent three laps behind the Safety Car whilst recovery crews removed White’s FIRST NEON car from the circuit - at the same time the pit window had opened, so the bulk of the field streamed down pit lane the following lap for their compulsory stop, but not before Paddon had made a clean getaway to be more than four seconds up on the pack which had been caught behind Greg Kenny.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly for Kenny, his car broke a driveshaft almost immediately after exiting the dummy grid for the start of the race, forcing him down pit lane on the opening lap, the well drilled RA Motorsports team taking just four laps to replace it to be able to send him out to turn laps, but between Paddon and Perini.</p>\n\n<p>Paddon was one of the first down pit lane to effect his stop having felt he held enough of an advantage to be within fighting distance of Perini and Burke once the stops were completed, but Perini didn’t pit, he put his head down and charged in an effort to breach the gap now that Burke was no longer filling his mirrors.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately his pace was so good that he started to catch the slower cars, getting caught behind David Crampton - who had taken over the #3 Vantage Freight entry from co-driver Anthony Davis during the stop - on the run down the mountain.</p>\n\n<p>100% committed to breaching the gap to leader Paddon, Perini became very animated, waving madly at Crampton to move over, but with very little opportunity to do so, Crampton held his line down to Forrest’s Elbow before having space to allow Perini through.</p>\n\n<p>The situation obviously had an affect on Perini who continued to charge, going past the pit entry not once, but twice, to ultimately miss his opportunity to make his compulsory stop during the 20-minute window. With a penalty post-race pending he continued to charge, but just a couple of laps later he was hard into the barriers in the Esses, coming to rest sideways to the flow of traffic just a little bit further down the circuit than where Peter White had gone in earlier.</p>\n\n<p>That was game over, and ultimately the end of the race as with less than five minutes remaining, the recovery crew were never going to be able to clear the stricken #81 SR3 within the allocated race time. Fortunately - like White - Perini wasn’t hurt, although shaken up and bruised, officials helping him to limp away from the car.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst all this was going on though, Kim Burke had emerged from pit lane after his CPS in second position behind once-a-year ‘specialist’ Nick Stavropolous who had inherited the lead after being ‘penalty’ free from the opening race having finished outside the top five.</p>\n\n<p>Burke had left pit lane five seconds earlier than Paddon - whom he’d pitted five seconds behind by virtue of his third placed finish in race one - and he was quickly onto the tail of Stavropolous who gave very little challenge in the end as Burke moved through to the front, but Paddon could do little about the two leaders as the Safety Car reappeared for Perini’s accident at the top of the mountain, ending a winning streak that had stretched to Friday’s race win - his seventh consecutive SR3 victory on the mountain.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth across the line after an incredible drive again, was Michael Whiting, although post race he was handed a penalty for overtaking too early after the Safety Car, as was Chris Medland who had finished a lonely sixth behind Nick Kelly.</p>\n\n<p>With Whiting and Chris Medland demoted post-race, Tony Haggarty was classified fifth - his best ever finish on the mountain (one better than 2017) - with Bill Medland sixth having recovered from a second rear-of-field start after a header issue during qualifying left him sidelined and unable to record a timed lap.</p>\n\n<p>Rowan Ross was another who had made a recovery, taking seventh in his brand new 2018 SR3RSX after the RA team had rebuilt the left side overnight courtesy of his brush with the wall at turn two on the opening lap of the season having been forced to avoid a spinning Michael Whiting.</p>\n\n<p>Phil Ansleine was a consistent eighth after another great battle with Peter Clare who unfortunately was unable to return to the fight after the CPS with officials noticing a rear light failure on the car forcing him to stay in pit lane a few laps longer as the RA Motorsports crew effected repairs.</p>\n\n<p>Sue Hughes was a delighted ninth, having made considerable gains on her past Bathurst experiences thanks to removing aero drag from the car, something which at first had kept her busy, but as the laps wore on she became more and more comfortable with how the car was moving around.</p>\n\n<p>David Crampton and Anthony Davis rounded out the top ten after a consistent effort through the 45-minute race, staying out of trouble and gaining valuable championship points, whilst Michael Whiting, Chris Medland and Peter Clare were the final classified finishers.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately Paddon was given the round win - despite sharing a win and a third placed finish with Burke - by virtue of his top qualifying effort and his two fastest race laps. Burke was second with the returning Nick Kelly third thanks to a fifth and third placed finish.</p>\n\n<p>The championship now moves onto round two at the all-new Bend Motorsport Park in South Australia on 13-15 April.</p>\n\n\n\n    <p><a class=\"button button--revealer\" data-panel-reveal=\"reveal-panel-399\" data-reveal-label=\"Read More\" data-hide-label=\"Hide It\">Read More</a></p>\n    <div id=\"reveal-panel-399\" data-reveal-copy=\"\">\n      <p>What the drivers had to say:</p>\n\n<p>1. Kim Burke (Radical Australia Radical SR3RS)</p>\n\n<p><em>“The mechanics worked very hard on the car overnight and transformed it, it was fantastic today, balanced, fast and easy to drive. I had a great battle with Chris Perini early on, but unfortunately he had an incident so we couldn’t finish it off. It’s all about the championship this year. I’ve been close a couple of times in the past, but this year I want to finish every race and be in the fight for the title.”</em></p>\n\n<p>2. Nick Stavropolous (Radical SR3)</p>\n\n<p><em>“That was incredible, but I didn’t actually realise I was in front when Kim [Burke] caught me, my crew didn’t tell me, although I probably wouldn’t have been able to keep him behind me for long anyway, but what a great recovery after a tough day yesterday. Third here in race two last year, second this year..

          "content": "<p>Also enjoying a return to the top step of the podium after a four-year absence was long-time Radical competitor Simon Haggarty, whilst new Radical recruit John-Paul Drake capped off a fantastic debut with a podium finish in both 50-minute races.</p>\n\n<p>Typically Melbourne in late Spring can be a testing place to be, and Mother Nature unleashed a variety of challenges across the weekend, making tyre choice difficult, but ultimately it was points leader Kim Burke who carried his impressive 2018 form to pole for both races, despite the pace being set - unofficially - by James Winslow early in the weekend, the RAC driver coach assisting new recruit John-Paul Drake with his transition across to the mighty SR3RS of Chris Medland.</p>\n\n<p>By the time the grid was set for the two races, Burke emerged the pace-setter, his 1:13.4662 an indication of the track condition, with James Winslow’s 2017 qualifying lap record of 1:11.8149 remaining intact for another year. Behind him, race lap record holder Simon Haggarty was second quickest for both races, ahead of Chris Perini and Tony Haggarty. South Australian top point-scorers Brad and Mitch Neilson claimed a start from the third row despite Mitch Neilson’s impressive pace which was good enough for a front row start, but on combined times, they would kick off from the third row.</p>\n\n<p>With the weather dry but cool for the start of the opening race, Kim Burke charged off the line with the two HRT entries of Simon Haggarty and Tony Haggarty in close pursuit, Tony spectacular off the start to charge to third. Sadly it was relatively short-lived after suffering a spin at Dandenong Road corner having not quite established enough tyre temperature in his control Dunlops, dropping him to rear-of-field as a result.</p>\n\n<p>Tony Haggarty’s misfortune though had handed JP Drake a net gain, with Rowan Ross forced wide to avoid the #6 RSX which was sideways across the exit of the corner, Drake went inside to gain a place to set off in pursuit of Mitchell Neilson and Chris Perini ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Burke was first in once the compulsory pit stop window opened, and with a 15-second success penalty on top of the standard 60-second stop he knew he needed to make a clean getaway, but despite achieving just that he emerged behind Simon Haggarty after the HRT driver had effected his stop having punched out a sequence of hot laps before coming down pit lane.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, in an almost identical position to his father on the opening lap, Simon’s lead came unstuck with less than 20-minutes to go, losing the tail of his SR3 on the exit of Dandenong Road corner, handing Kim Burke a big lead. Haggarty’s charge back to the tail of Burke was one of the highlights of the closing laps, the #5 entry crossing the line just nine tenths of a second down on Burke, despite having been more than 11-seconds behind at one point.</p>\n\n<p>That fight wasn’t the only one keeping the fans on their feet, the battle between John-Paul Drake and Chris Perini over third too was intense, Drake lamenting a spin at turn two after his stop which allowed Perini to recover the 40-seconds he’d lost to Drake during the pit-stop [by virtue of his compensation time], but in the end JP too prevailed, although by just three one hundredths of a second at the line.</p>\n\n<p>Brad Neilson crossed the line in position five, ahead of the recovering Tony Haggarty who suffered a big off across the top late in the race, fortunately without drama, to claim sixth. Sadly for Rowan Ross, he too suffered an off at the top of the circuit, spinning into the barriers on the damp grass, forcing his retirement on lap three, providing the RA Motorsports crew with some heavy work to do ahead of the second 50-minute race later in the day.</p>\n\n<p>Off pole for the second race of the weekend, Kim Burke wasn’t about to let Simon Haggarty get too close, the points leader charging away at the front of the field as behind him Simon Haggarty once more had his mirrors full of his father’s #6 entry before Chris Perini charged into third by the close of the opening lap.</p>\n\n<p>John-Paul Drake too looked menacing again early, eventually passing Tong Haggarty for fourth seven laps in, before a procession of cars hit pit lane as soon as the pit window opened, Kim Burke forced to endure a much longer stop by virtue of his race one win. That was all the incentive Simon Haggarty needed, although as the laps wound down his mirrors were once more filled with the brilliant multi-coloured livery of Burke, in that menacing Mark Webber-esque yellow helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Despite immense pressure from Burke, Haggarty held his ground to score his first outright win since 2014, with Burke content to be second to card the biggest haul of points for the season and extend his championship points lead. Again - as it had been in race one - much of the late race focus was on the battle for third, with Chris Perini setting the fastest lap of the race on his charge through to the tail of Drake lamenting an off at turn one after trying a passing move under brakes.</p>\n\n<p>As that was happening Mitch Neilson was forced into recovery mode after his own spin on the exit of turn four, fortunately without damage, although a slow run to the pits to check the condition of the #38 entry dropped him to rear of field after being within reach of the podium battle between Drake and Perini.</p>\n\n<p>Despite an epic effort over the closing laps, Perini was forced to settle once more for fourth, this time six tenths down on Drake, although the pair were 16-seconds back from the battle for the lead, with Haggarty weathering all of Burke’s attentions for the win.</p>\n\n<p>Rowan Ross crossed the line fifth with full credit going to the RA Motorsports team who had worked feverishly after the opening race incident to have him ready for race two, Tony Haggarty carding a solid haul of points in sixth, ahead of Mitch Neilson who crossed the line three laps down on the leaders after his spin.</p>\n\n<p>For the Radical Australia Cup teams, next round is one of the most popular on the calendar, an event that regularly shakes up the championship, with a visit to the Phillip Island Grand Prix circuit on the first weekend in June as part of the Shannons Nationals for two more 50-minute races, Phillip Island also recently revealed as the host event of the season finale on 2-4 November to cap off the tenth season of the Cup.</p>\n\n\n\n    <p><a class=\"button button--revealer\" data-panel-reveal=\"reveal-panel-447\" data-reveal-label=\"Read More\" data-hide-label=\"Hide It\">Read More</a></p>\n    <div id=\"reveal-panel-447\" data-reveal-copy=\"\">\n      <p><strong>Rnd#3 2018 Radical Australia Cup<br>\nSandown Motor Raceway, Melbourne, Victoria<br>\n11-13 May, 2018</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Qualifying - Race#1</strong><br>\n1. 68.

          "content": "<p>With 182bhp, advanced aerodynamics and a sequential gearbox, the generation 2 SR1 has proven a hit with both experienced and novice drivers alike, with grids in the SR1 Cup steadily growing as more and more drivers look to learn the ropes in sportscar racing.</p>\n\n<p>Stoney has so far been the class of the field, following his perfect four-race streak across both the Oulton Park and Cadwell Park rounds. In fact, Stoney has led every racing lap of the season so far and holds a 39-point lead ahead of this weekend. But the signs are there that he’s unlikely to have things all his own way for the rest of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Reigning SR1 Cup champion James Pinkerton pushed Stoney hard at Cadwell and was in contention to halt the championship leader’s run until he suffered a costly retirement in the second outing. Pinkerton has competed in the opening two rounds this year with the Avidity Motorsport team, but has yet to confirm any further participation.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Short (Works) has also enjoyed a strong start to the year, celebrating twin podium finishes at Oulton. He would undoubtedly have been in the mix at Cadwell had it not been for an accident during pre-event testing. Regardless, he bounced back to grab another third place and prove his mettle. Renewed confidence will make him one of the leading candidates to depose Stoney this weekend. Short’s form also means he leads the Fangio Trophy class, for drivers aged 40 and over.</p>\n\n<p>“Cadwell was a difficult weekend because it was the first time I’ve really had an accident, and hitting the wall at 70mph certainly woke me up!” says Short. “The car looked after me brilliantly and my driver coach, Roger Bromiley, got me straight back out there in a spare chassis. It’s tough to get an accident out of your head and get your confidence back, but the fact that I got back on the podium the day after shows the highs and lows of this sport, and I impressed myself!</p>\n\n<p>“I’ve got high expectations for Brands Hatch. I had a Rookie Class win there last season and I have to be aiming for the overall podium this time around, and seeing how high I can get on it. It’ll be tough as Brands is a track many drivers know well and have a lot of confidence at, so it should be a very tight weekend. But it’s been a great start to the season for me, now I just want to build on that.”</p>\n\n<p>Last year’s Rookie Cup champion Will Hunt will be looking to continue his upward trend after scoring his first rostrum finish of 2019 with a fine drive to second during the finale at Cadwell Park. The Scorpio Motorsport man certainly has the potential to be in the mix for race wins. Ex-Fun Cup driver Matt Jones is the only other driver to have stood on the podium this season.</p>\n\n<p>Former BMW racer Ross Elliott (Avidity Motorsport) is improving with every outing, while Lotus convert Dean Warriner (Track Focused) finished second here last season and will be aiming to go one better this weekend. Mark Tranter (Privateer) leads the Rookie Cup, but will face renewed opposition from Simon Bailey (Track Focused) and newcomer Sam Ashworth (360 Racing).</p>\n\n<p>The third round SR1 Cup action at Brands Hatch on Saturday, June 8 starts with qualifying at 9:00 followed by two 20-minute races at 12:05 and 15:40.

Announcing that the race had been declared wet, rain lights and headlights were on as more than 30 drivers took to the puddle-filled racecourse.</p>\n\n<p>Field (ONE Motorsports) led the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America competitors to the flag and was able to control the pace from there on. Having to undergo several restarts after caution periods, the former American Le Mans Series driver was able to drive to his first Platinum class win of the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>“Indy Al” Miller (ONE Motorsports), who had a pass down the escape road on lap two, rebounded to add another podium finish to his results resume as he finished just ahead of Wayne Williams (ESSES Racing) who had an incredible drive to third. A former dirt car racer, Williams was enjoying the slick conditions so much so that he earned the fastest lap of race one and the accompanying pole position for race two. Canadian driver Kevin Poitras (Radical Canada) was the best of the rest as he was classified in P4, just ahead of Louis Schriber (RYNO Racing) in fifth.</p>\n\n<p>Current Pro 1500-point leader Nick Persing (Radical Northwest,&nbsp;pictured, top) extended that lead when the checkered flag flew at the end of race one as he took the victory in wet conditions ahead of his championship rival and WISKO Racing driver Danny Dyszelski in second. Persing also went on to secure the fastest lap of the race and pole position for race two later this afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Canadian Robert Soroka (RySpec Racing) was able to climb to the third step of the podium in his home country adding another podium finish for the potent RySpec Racing program. Veteran racer Gregg Gorski (ONE Motorsports) was hoping to challenge for a podium result, but a late race caution ruined any chances of that as he was forced to settle for fourth ahead of another Canadian, Racing With Autism driver and reigning Pro 1340 champion Austin Riley.</p>\n\n<p>In the Pro 1340 ranks, &nbsp;Ken Savage (G-Tech Motorsports) proved his wet weather prowess as he turned the fastest race lap on route to the win Saturday morning beating Robert Cipriani-Detres (Team Stradale) to the checkered flag. Additionally, Savage earned the Sunoco Hard Charger Award. NOLA Motorsports Park race winner Jace Bacon (Crown Racing) found himself back on the podium with a third-place result as Huw Leahy (Radical Canada East) and Seth Bacon (Crown Racing) rounded out the top-five.</p>\n\n<p>Race two on the weekend was run under dry conditions as drivers returned to using the slick Hankook Tires with the green flag flying just before 6:00pm local time. Field was once again the class of the field as he easily drove to his second Platinum class win of the weekend as put on a masterclass. With a best lap that was much faster than his competitors, Field earned the race three pole position. Louis Schriber celebrated on the podium next to Field as Wayne Williams earned his first career Blue Marble Radical Cup podium result. Kevin Poitras finished fifth, his second top-five result on the day. A hard-charging Al Miller was able to sneak by on the last lap for fourth and scored the second-fastest lap of the race after an issue in the open stages that relegated him down the running order.</p>\n\n<p>In the Pro 1500 race, a new name appeared at the top of the result sheet as Gregg Gorski kept his nose clean and out of trouble as some of his competitors found it. Robert Soroka was able to take the lead at the start disposing of championship contenders Nick Persing and Danny Dyszelski who were pushed back to second and third respectively. However, on lap six, the top three on the track were together in Turn 3 as they all sustained damage that was not repairable forcing all three to retire, much to the delight of Aurora Straus and Austin Riley who claimed the second and third steps on the podium. It provided some momentum for Riley, who will race in Silverstone next weekend for the Radical UK program.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Anzaldi (RYNO Racing) wasn’t able to keep Riley behind him in the last five minutes of the race but kept it in the right direction and off the walls to score a solid result in fourth ahead of Arul Venkatesh (Radical Northwest) in fifth.</p>\n\n<p>With Savage out of the race on lap five and classified in fifth, Cipriani-Detres reigned supreme in the Pro 1340 class to take his first win of the weekend. The “Bacon Boyz” were able to climb to the podium in P2 and P3 with father Seth beating son Jace to the checkered flag. Huw Leahy was able to soldier on and finish fourth.</p>"

Jeff Green came away with two wins in the 1500 class, as did Comeau in the 1340 class. Gustavo Rafols and Greg Gorski won in the wet, and Terry Olson took a clean sweep in the Masters class.\n\nA sea of motorhomes, grills, flags and fans surrounded Canada’s original Formula 1 venue for an action-packed weekend which billed Radical alongside NASCAR, Pirelli World Challenge and the Canadian Touring Car Championship.\n\nWith the 19 Radical drivers representing both sides of the boarder, the great sporting rivalry that is CAN-AM competition drew out plenty of big performances.\n\nDuring practice American and Radical guru Jeff Green (Team Stradale) lapped the 2.459-mile circuit in 1:18.994 to decimate the previous unofficial 1500 class lap record of 1:19.597 set by Richard Thomas in qualifying during the 2016 Radical Cup event. The performance no doubt aided by the switch to Hankook tires for the 2018 season."

          "content": "<p>Green continued his pace in qualifying to take the outright pole position with a 1:19.395, impressively beating the V8 powered SR8 of Canadian Bruce McIntyre (Radical Canada, Masters) who would share the front row for Race 1. The pair were two of four drivers to go under 1 minute and 20 seconds, and remarkably the top seven drivers in qualifying were covered by less than a second.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nCompleting Friday in text book fashion, Green lead from start to finish to take the outright victory and set a new official 1500 class lap record of 1:19.399, eclipsing George Kurtz’s long held benchmark of 1:20.342 from 2014.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nGreen won the 1500 class in dominant fashion over points leader Indy Al Miller (One Motorsports), who critically finished in front of championship rival Greg Gorski (One Motorsports).<br>\n<br>\nTerry Olson (WISKO Racing) finished second outright and first in the Masters class, reversing fortunes with the strong qualifying McIntyre, who fell back through the field on his way to claim second in class.The only major incident in Race 1 was a crash involving Will Lin (Radical Northwest / Cameron Racing, 1500), Louis Schriber (Team Stradale, 1340) and Dan Earle (SCC Autosport, 1340), which resulted in Lin making significant contact with the pit lane entry wall, and Earle being handed a drive through penalty.<br>\n<br>\nThe race featured a number of standout performances in the 1340 class. Tim Sanderson (Rilli Racing / Northwest Atlantic Motorsports) came from 14th on the grid to finish ninth overall and fifth in class, while the drive of the day went to Matt Graham (Radical Canada), who rose from the final row of the grid to finish fourth in class behind Greg Boland (SCC Autosport). Second placed Rafols was also outstanding. The young gun set a new official 1340 class lap record of 1:20.327, which must have infuriated race winner Antoine Comeau, who and held the record since 2016 with a 1:20.509.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nIn fact, given his pace, many were wondering what might have been if Rafols hadn’t got stuck behind the 1500s of Miller and Gorski in Race 1. Those questions were soon answered. Saturday morning saw the heavens open, and the young Puerto Rican star in extremely treacherous conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Before the race had even begun, the track had claimed a number of victims including pole sitter Green, who spun on the first of three parade laps. Anir Dhir (Racing Analytics, 1340) was by far the unluckiest casualty– heavy contact with the wall ended his race and weekend prematurely– and extended the safety car period.<br>\n<br>\nOnce the green flag finally flew, the field got through Turn 1 and Turn 2 unscathed before Rafols was lucky to avoid a spinning Miller in Turn 3. This helped the WISKO Racing driver advance into second place behind race leader, and eventual Masters Class winner Olson.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nBy Lap 10 Rafols had cleared Olson and, in what was his first ever rain race in a car, began to school the field. As his father nervously looked on Rafols never put a foot wrong, even once he came under pressure of the hard charging Comeau. In fact, it was the reigning champ who eventually cracked, spinning though Turn 9 in a final act of desperation to try and deny the Puerto Rican of his first ever Blue Marble Cocktails Radical Cup win.</p>\n\n<p>Having taken the outright victory against much faster machinery, as well as the 1340 class win, Rafols impressed the Pirelli World Challenge paddock as did Matt Graham who clinched second in class after capitalizing on Comeau’s demise to third.<br>\n<br>\nSanderson again had a strong run from the back of the grid to set a time good enough for Race 3’s second row on his way to fourth in class, while Alan Shaw (Rilli Racing) completed the top five in the 1340 class.<br>\n<br>\nGorski and Miller thrilled the fans with an amazing dual. The pair entered Turn 1 side by side on a number of laps, traded places at Turn 5 and both survived spins. In the end Miller’s late race 360 at Turn 8 cost him the win, but he gave it his all until the final corner, with an attempt around the outside of Gorski seeing Miller on the grass as the pair approached the line in a photo finish. It wasn’t enough, and Gorski claimed a well-earned win over his championship rival. Green recovered to take third in the 1500 class, with Lin finishing fourth. McIntyre survived to take second in the Masters Class.</p>\n\n<p>Elation from the previous day’s win quickly turned to heartache for Rafols come Sunday morning, just as had happened to Green 24 hours prior. A fuel leak was spotted from his machine as it was being warmed-up on the grid, forcing Rafols to retire.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nChris Souliotis (1340) then added to WISKO Racing’s woes, spinning in Turn 2 to bring out a brief safety car on Lap 4.

          "content": "<p>The Brands Hatch weekend featured three different winners and three tense races condensed into a single day, meaning consistency would be key for anybody to get ahead. In truth, it could well have been a double for Jackson, had it not been for an error from de Sadeleer in race one that cost them both dear, and opened the door for Marcus Clutton to take his first points-scoring Challenge victory of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson then regrouped to control race two, before de Sadeleer’s weekend finally came good, ensuring that he stays right on the tail of the championship leader with a single round still to run.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race One</strong><br>\nThings looked to be going to plan for the title contenders as they filled the front row in championship order before race one, but the pack was soon jumbled after a mix-up on a safety car restart dealt a bitter blow for both Jackson and de Sadeleer, but set up Clutton to take a last-gasp victory.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson left it late in qualifying to snatch pole, the championship leader&nbsp;edging de Sadeleer to top spot by 0.205sec with his final flying effort of the session. Clutton would start third ahead of Constable, on row two, but both would soon benefit from the bizarre incident.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson got a solid start to hold off de Sadeleer into Paddock Hill as Constable made a fine move on Clutton stick for third at Druids.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson looked comfortable out front in the early stages, extending his advantage over his title rival to the best part of two seconds as de Sadeleer’s attentions turned to holding off Constable, Clutton and Joe Stables as the top five pulled away.</p>\n\n<p>But the order was turned on its head when the safety car was called after Brian Caudwell went off at Paddock Hill and struck the barriers. That bunched the pack back up and sparked the incident between the leaders. As Jackson and the following de Sadeleer warmed their tyres ahead of the restart there was contact into Stirlings, which sent Jackson into a spin and damaged the front of de Sadeleer’s SR3.</p>\n\n<p>The net result was Constable leading Clutton and Marcello Marateotto when racing resumed, with de Sadeleer rejoining fourth and Jackson down in 13th&nbsp;and with it all to do. With the pit window opening shortly after the incident, Clutton stopped first, followed swiftly by both de Sadeleer and the recovering Jackson, who had worked his way nicely back up the order. With five seconds less to spend on his mandatory stop, Jackson vaulted back ahead of de Sadeleer as the two rejoined on the fringes of the top five.</p>\n\n<p>One driver who stayed out was Constable, who used the clean air to pump in a series of&nbsp;quick laps before finally diving into the pits with just moments of the window remaining. The tactic worked, with Constable rejoining comfortably clear of Marateotto, who had Clutton crawling all over him for second.</p>\n\n<p>Clutton showed his nose repeatedly into Hawthorn and eventually pressured Marateotto into a mistake at Clark Curve, the Italian skipping through the gravel and dropping to third.</p>\n\n<p>The order seemed set, until one final safety car was called when Jon MacRae beached his SR3 in the gravel at Paddock. That was bad news for Constable, who had his lead eroded and was now faced with a single-lap shootout to the flag. Clutton sensed his opportunity, and attacked Constable when racing resumed, getting a good tow up Hawthorn Hill before eventually pulling off a brave move into Westfield to snatch top spot with just a handful of corners left.</p>\n\n<p>Marateotto took&nbsp;third ahead of Jackson, whose strong recovery to fourth place at least helped him extend his points gap over de Sadeleer, who could only manage sixth with his damaged car. John MacLeod split the title chasers in fifth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race Two</strong><br>\nAfter his disappointment in race one, Jackson wasn’t prepared to let a second shot at glory slip away, and duly secured a seventh race win of the year to edge closer to the championship as de Sadeleer again had an outing to forget.</p>\n\n<p>The Swiss racer was handed a five-place grid penalty for his part in the race one contact, so would start just seventh as his title rival lined up on pole.</p>\n\n<p>However, Jackson got too much wheelspin at the start and was quickly usurped by the flying Mark Richards, who got a great launch from row two to streak into the lead at Paddock.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson recovered to hold off the charging Constable for&nbsp;second, and soon set his sights on the race leader. Jackson whittled down the gap each lap, eventually securing the lead&nbsp;late in the seventh lap. Once ahead, nobody could touch him as Jackson surged to another victory.</p>\n\n<p>Richards had his hands full with fending off Constable to take second, while race one winner Clutton took fourth after a last-lap charge just fell short. De Sadeleer’s race began well, with him picking off Clutton and Brian Caudwell on the first lap, but a spin exiting Druids on lap two dented his hopes and ultimately left him fifth at the flag.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race Three</strong><br>\nHaving endured a largely torrid weekend so far, de Sadeleer finally came good in the final outing with a controlled drive to net his sixth race win of the year, and limit the damage in the championship battle.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson started the race on pole and led the entire early stages from the chasing Constable, Clutton and de Sadeleer as the top four largely broke away to form their own private battle. However, with all&nbsp;of the cars ahead of him having to serve additional seconds stationary during their mandatory pit stop, de Sadeleer could play the waiting game and limit the time loss to the leaders, knowing his faster stop would serve him well.</p>\n\n<p>Of the top four, de Sadeleer and Clutton were the first to stop. But with Clutton carrying a 20-second&nbsp;success penalty from his race one win, he was essentially out of the fight. Whereas de Sadeleer rejoined in clean air and inherited the lead when both Constable and Jackson served their stops a few laps later.</p>\n\n<p>Once ahead, de Sadeleer controlled the pace and survived a brief safety car restart late on to secure&nbsp;the win ahead of Jackson. Constable should have been in the running for third but copped a stop-go penalty for shaving a second off his mandatory stop time, which limited him to 12th&nbsp;at the flag.</p>\n\n<p>That –&nbsp;combined with a technical issue ruling out the otherwise rapid Joe Stables – opened the door for series newcomer Shane Stoney. The current SR1 Cup dominator was on his first outing in an SR3, and shone in the final race, climbing from eighth on the grid to hold fifth for much of the race, and then move into a podium spot after the stops. Clutton harried the newcomer across the closing laps, but Stoney stood firm to grab a superb debut podium. Richards ended his weekend in fifth, just ahead of Elliot Goodman.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver Quotes</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Marcus Clutton, Valour Racing (Winner race one):</strong> “It was a tough race. We had the 15-second success penalty from Silverstone and I never thought I’d be in a position to challenge for the win! After the incident under the safety car, it was myself and Jac. Jac wasn’t holding me up but when you follow a Radical really close you struggle with the front end. So I boxed early and got some clear space, then I just got so lucky with the second safety car. Without the safety car, Jac would have won, no doubts about that. Heading up to Hawthorns, I got a good run on him, he blocked me and I thought I’d try the switch back. I’ve never tried it before but I somehow pulled it off to nip up the inside, no contact just great racing.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dominik Jackson, RAW Motorsports (Winner race two):</strong> “I didn’t get a good start to race two and Mark got an amazing one, we got settled in and I was struggling to attack him so I dropped back. I caught back up then got an opportunity to pull off quite a decent move around the outside at Clearways. We’re in a good position in the championship after this.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jérôme de Sadeleer, 360 Racing (Winner race three):</strong>&nbsp;“The two first races were pretty tough, I had unfortunate contact with Dominik in the first race, I think he’s still unhappy with me. Otherwise the final&nbsp;race was pretty good, I kept it clean and the safety car before the pit stops benefited me, the second one didn’t but I was ahead and managed to pull a gap. A sixth win of the year is pretty good and I’m not far behind. If one of us gets a DNF either way, it’s going to be quite close to deciding a champion, so we just have to keep it clean, keep it consistent.”&nbsp;</p>"

          "content": "<p>Heading into the penultimate rounds four points adrift of Barker, Lang started his mission to regain the top spot by taking his first pole position of the year with just three minutes of qualifying remaining. Jack Manchester clocked in second fastest ahead of Barker and Dominik Jackson while Kristian Jeffrey and Marcello Marateotto completed the top six. Peter Tyler and Paul Gladdis took their second consecutive Team Challenge pole position.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lang turned his first Radical Challenge pole position into win number four, keeping his cool throughout two safety cars and a single-lap dash to the line to move back to the top of the title table.</p>\n\n<p>Although clean away at the lights, chaos ensued as the field went four-wide into Paddock Hill Bend forcing several cars, including Barker, Burgess, Kristian Jeffrey and Marcello Marateotto, to take avoiding action. This triggered the first full course caution.</p>\n\n<p>As racing proper got underway with 13 minutes remaining, Lang kept Manchester at bay while John Macleod, up from 13th on the grid, held off Jackson. Despite only two racing laps completed before the second safety car, the recovering Barker climbed from 23rd to 16th.</p>\n\n<p>With barely more than a minute remaining as racing resumed, Lang and Manchester held station to the line. But there was time for one last change to the podium finishers as Jackson overhauled Macleod for third. Fifth for Brian Murphy sealed his best season performance ahead of Richard Baxter. John Caudwell and Stuart Moseley took Team Challenge victory, ninth overall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Radical Challenge championship pendulum swung in the opposite direction for the second sprint race, as Barker delivered a storming drive to victory from the second row while Lang finished fifth.</p>\n\n<p>A flying start saw the Nielsen Racing driver overhaul pole-sitter Manchester and Lang off the line to lead into Paddock Hill Bend. As the opening lap tussles played out, Barker remained ahead of Manchester and Jackson with Lang lying fifth, until an unsuccessful challenge on Marateotto dropped him to seventh.</p>\n\n<p>A three-way fight for the lead soon unfolded with Barker, Manchester and Jackson running line astern, swapping purple sectors and fastest laps. A run wide from Manchester on lap five, however, saw Jackson move up to second before a brief safety car period to remove the leading Team Challenge Caudwell/Moseley car from Druids on lap seven.</p>\n\n<p>Back to green on lap nine, it was a clear run to the chequered flag. Murphy went one better than his race one form to finish fourth ahead of Lang, Macleod rounding out the top six. Team Challenge honours went to class newcomers Peter and Matt Brookes, 11th overall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Race 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Radical Challenge field was denied the opportunity of a full-on final feature race as all but four of the 13 laps were completed under the safety car. The rain began to fall as the field began their second formation lap and although clean away at the rolling start, five cars including pole-sitter and then race leader Lang slid off at Clearways, Manchester following him into the gravel. This dictated a full course yellow from the start of lap two.</p>\n\n<p>While Jackson led from Barker and Spencer Bourne, Burgess ran seventh after starting from the back of the 27-car grid, as the remaining field circulated under the safety car.</p>\n\n<p>The field returned to green with six minutes remaining, but that’s all Barker needed to scythe his way through from fourth to first within a single lap of the 2.433-mile circuit. The Nielsen Racing charge pulled out an astonishing 9.7 second lead in the following three laps to take his sixth win of the season.</p>\n\n<p>With second and third on track, Barry Liversidge and Dominik Jackson, both handed respective 30 second penalties following the race, Mark Crader was classified second. Caudwell and Moseley sealed an outstanding weekend with Team Challenge victory and third overall, while Burgess picked up Solo Challenge points for third.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driver Quotes</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Oliver Barker</strong>: “I didn’t expect that, at all! With the success penalty from Snetterton the best we thought we’d get was seventh, eighth position. Conditions played to us but I want to thank the team for turning the car around so quickly at the pit stop, I think it was the team that won that race for us. It was a case of getting back out there and getting used to the conditions. I think I managed to get past four cars on one lap, which was quite cool! We got the win and we’re leading the championship now, so I’m really looking forward to Snetterton.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mark Crader</strong>: “That was a lucky result from 11th on the grid, but we’ll take them where we can, of course. I’m looking forward to Snetterton as we had some problems with the car last time, so it will be good to end the season well there.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Steve Burgess</strong>: “It’s not been the best of days, so to get a podium in the last race from the back of the grid is quite a surprise! I was helped out with the other guys’ success penalties and the rain, but it wasn’t my day. I think third in the championship is the realistic aim going into Snetterton now.”</p>\n\n<p>For full Brands Hatch race results visit <a href=\"http://www.tsl-timing.com\">www.tsl-timing.com</a></p>"

          "content": "It was a trip to the picturesque Sonoma Raceway for the final round of the 2022 Blue Marble Radical Cup North America program. With championships on the line, racing was hard and competitive as drivers pushed their machines and themselves to the limits to gain as many positions as possible in their quest to climb to the top step of the podium. History was made throughout the weekend with Aurora Straus becoming the first female to win in Radical Cup North America competition, while Autistic driver Austin Riley not only became the US Pro 1340 Champion– doubling up on his Canadian title from 2021– but the overall series champion too."

          "content": "<h3>Platinum</h3>\n\n<p>After Friday’s test and practice sessions it was Esses Racing’s Judd Miller who topped the Platinum Class results sheets in qualifying ahead of championship point leader Steve Jenks and Scott Wagner.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Jenks closed in on his quest for the Platinum Class Championship scoring the race one win by nearly three seconds over pole position winner Judd Miller. It was Jim Booth who joined Jenks and Miller on the podium after the 22-lap race disposing of Scott Wagner who qualified on the inside of the second row in the Platinum class but fell to fourth on the results sheets. Charles Finelli (Fat Boy Racing) showed speed early but was forced to retire on lap 13 in his Radical Cup debut.</p>\n\n<p>After a delay for fog at the start of race two, Esses Racing driver Judd Miller would jump to the front and never look back despite a hard-charging American Le Mans Series veteran Jon Field. Miller would lead flag-to-flag to take the win by just over six-tenths of a second to Field who earned the fastest lap of the race and the hard-charger award as he drove from deep in the field to finish second in class and second overall.</p>\n\n<p>Jenks crossed the line in third to put a stranglehold on the Platinum Class Championship with Jim Booth and Scott Wagner rounding out the top-five. Five different teams were represented in the top-five on the results sheets–&nbsp;Esses Racing, One Motorsports, Group-A Racing, Wisko Racing, and Scott Wagner Racing– while the top-four were separated by less than two seconds when the checkered flag flew.</p>\n\n<p>It was a quick turnaround for the third and final race of the weekend, and the final race of the 2022 season but drivers would once again take to the track for one last opportunity. Jon Field found another level, and yet again rose to the occasion and garnered maximum points in the final wheel-to-wheel action of the Blue Marble Radical Cup North America season. Steve Jenks crossed the line second and confirmed his Platinum Class Championship as Judd Miller completed the final podium of 2022. Jim Booth and Scott Wagner both added top-five finishes.</p>\n\n<h3>Pro 1500</h3>\n\n<p>Gregg Gorski (Smokebuddy / One Motorsports) returned to the series with a vengeance, taking the pole position in the Pro 1500 class, edging Palmer Miller who led the current 1500-point standings while Will Lin slotted into third.</p>\n\n<p>Starting fourth on the grid, Aurora Straus methodically worked her way to the second before pole position winner Gregg Gorski was forced to retire on lap 17 with a mechanical issue opening the door for Aurora to take a dominating win for Group-A Racing, strengthening their grip on the Pro 1500 Team Championship. The win also marked the first victory for Straus and the first for a first female driver in the Blue Marble Radical Cup.</p>\n\n<p>“I am super excited to win and to make history as the first female to win in Radical Cup competition in the United States,” explained Straus post-race. “I couldn't have done it without everyone around me, my sponsors, and my team Group-A. It's not the way we would have liked to win but we've still got two chances tomorrow to win it outright, and I know we have the speed to do it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Finishing second on track, Esses Racing driver Palmer Miller crucially finished ahead of the drivers he needed to beat to close in on the Pro 1500 championship. Leveling up three positions in race action, Ron Fletcher (Ryno Racing / BeachHouse858.com) improved on his P6 starting spot to nab the third and final step on the podium, just ahead of Will Lin, who narrowly beat Joe Nuxoll to the checkered flag by a scant two-thousandths of a second.</p>\n\n<p>Aurora Straus stayed true to her word, scoring her second win on Sunday morning with a penultimate lap pass on Palmer Miller. Esses Racing’s Miller appeared more than content with second place –&nbsp;his ninth podium of the season had secured the Pro 1500 championship. Will Lin was able to find his way back to the podium in third.</p>\n\n<p>Joe Nuxoll ran third for much of the race before a mechanical issue pushed him down the running order elevating Lin to third. Ron Fletcher crossed the stripe in fourth and like the Platinum class, put drivers from four different teams in the top-five with Esses Racing doubling up courtesy of Kent Myers in fifth. Gregg Gorski, who had secured the Pro 1500 class pole position thanks to the fastest lap in the first race, had his chances dashed on the pace lap due to a mechanical gremlin.</p>\n\n<p>With the championship already in his hands, Palmer Miller put an exclamation mark on the final event weekend with an outstanding win. Gregg Gorski was finally able to shake off his bad luck to stand on the podium in second after coming from the back of the pack and earned himself the Sunoco Hard Charger award. With two wins already to her credit, Aurora Straus made it three podiums over the course of two days to finish her weekend in third ahead of Joe Nuxoll and Will Lin. Straus had in fact led the race early on but fell behind on the pit stop exchange.</p>\n\n<h3>Pro 1340</h3>\n\n<p>Austin Riley began the final leg of his championship campaign in style, earning the class pole position for the first race. Reid Stewart was second fastest, while championship contender Mike Anzaldi found himself down the order after a self-inflicted mechanical gremlin curtailed his qualifying chances.</p>\n\n<p>Anzaldi, however, had a stellar opening lap, and in half a lap carved his way up through the field to pass Riley at the top end of the track. Riley then retook the Pro 1340 lead as the pair made the run from Turn 10 to Turn 11 with an inside pass, with both getting blocked by a slightly more cautious Ron Fletcher in a Pro 1500. The Pro 1340 championship then took a dramatic twist with Riley getting out of shape on the exit of Turn 11, which saw the rear of his car being tagged by Anzaldi who was already up against the wall, and the pair crashed heavily on the main straight. Despite their friendship and off-track sim battles, tension was in the air until Race Director Beaux Barfield declared the situation a racing incident. Riley would eventually be classified in the third position to extend his point lead over Anzaldi who was classified fourth.</p>\n\n<p>Reid Stewart and Brandon Wright were the benefactors of the Riley and Anzaldi contact as they went uncontested to finish first and second in class. It was rookie Reid Stewart's first Blue Marble Radical Cup North America win.</p>\n\n<p>With the added confidence of a win, Reid Stewart followed in the footsteps of Pro 1500 double weekend race winner Straus as he was able to fend off the advances of Austin Riley and Mike Anzaldi who were still battling for the championship. Stewart, who has been the class of the field all weekend long, earned the fastest lap of the race on route to his second trip to the top of the podium. Riley crossed the line in second all but assuring him the title, while Anzaldi joined Stewart and Riley on the podium in third. Brendan Wright finished fourth.</p>\n\n<p>Riley attained the Pro 1340 championship as the green flag flew on Race 3, but his celebrations were initially dampened with an off in Turn 2, which put his outright title hopes in jeopardy. After being stranded on a curb and falling several laps down, Riley was returned to the track to soldier on and finish fourth. Meanwhile, Mike Anzaldi finished his season in style scoring the final Pro 1340 win of the season, but as it wasn’t enough to take the class title – his focus now turns to the World Finals in Las Vegas. Reid Stewart capped off his weekend with a triple podium performance crossing the line in second, just ahead of the #888 machine of Brendan Wright.</p>\n\n<h3>Championships and Award</h3>\n\n<p>In claiming the Pro 1340 Championship, Austin Riley, who drives with Spark Power, Lincoln Electric, and Hagerty branding and is an autistic racer, had garnered enough points to tie with Pro 1500 champion Palmer Miller for the outright title. After a review of the points throughout the entire season, Riley earned the Overall Championship based on the number of wins– five to Miller’s four –&nbsp;and claimed the accompanying award and prize package to compete in a Radical Cup UK event in 2023. Steve Jenks earned the Platinum class title.</p>\n\n<p>Along with the championships, several additional awards were handed out during the Blue Marble Radical Cup Awards banquet Sunday evening as more than 80 crew members, team owners, drivers, and family members celebrated the season in the Wine Caves of the stunning Gloria Ferrer Winery.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Anzaldi of Ryno Racing received the coveted Jeff Green Memorial Award, recognizing his sportsmanship during the year, which included offering to transport rival Austin Riley’s race car to the final rounds of the championship.</p>\n\n<h3>Rookie of the Year – Reid Stewart, Group-A Racing</h3>\n\n<h3>Crew Member of the Year – Mike Eyler, Wisko Racing</h3>\n\n<h3>Platinum Team Champion – Wisko Racing</h3>\n\n<h3>Pro 1500 Team Champion – Group-A Racing</h3>\n\n<h3>Pro1340 Team Champion – Racing With Autism</h3>\n\n<p>With the 2022 Blue Marble Radical Cup North America season now complete, teams and competitors will shift their focus to the Radical World Finals Presented by Hankook at the Spring Mountain Motor Resort and Country Club from November 9 – 13th.</p>"

He is hoping his move brings him back into the title fight.

However, crash damage sustained at Watkins Glen curtailed his plans for this weekend and the young-gun has already turned his focus to the September 16-18 round at COTA. This gives second-place runner, Esses Racing’s Palmer Miller an opportunity to catch up and eclipse Everard in what has effectively become a two-horse race for the title.</p>\n\n<p>The battle for third through seventh in the points chase is a tight one with drivers separated by just 48 points, led by Esses Racing’s Kent Myers. A late entrant coming from the Radical Northwest / Cameron Racing outfit will be the #5 entry of Dan Decker. Decker will make his series debut this weekend in Utah as he looks to fight his way to the front of the Pro 1500 class.</p>\n\n<p>Racing with Autism’s Austin Riley (SparkPower) leads the Pro 1340 class, following a perfect weekend at Watkins Glen, where he took a trifecta of victories, pole positions and fastest laps.</p>\n\n<p>However, reigning champion Mike Anzaldi (Emmett’s Energy / RYNO Racing) sits just nine points behind Riley and will be looking to capture back the championship lead at the Campus.</p>\n\n<p>Reid Stewart (Fasano Textiles / Group-A Racing) is not one to count out either.&nbsp;Just 35 points further back from Anzaldi, he’s played runner-up four times this year and proved he has the pace to end up on the top step of the podium.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/799/original/4.jpg?1660144409 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/799/std/4.jpg?1660144409\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/799/std/4.jpg?1660144409\"></p>\n\n<p><em>Mike Anzaldi (L), Austin Riley (C) and Reid Stewart (R) are regulars on the Radical Cup podium.</em></p>\n\n<p>Blue Marble Radical Cup North America teams and competitors will hit the track on Friday for four practice sessions prior to qualifying and the first two wheel-to-wheel races on Saturday, at 11:20am and 3:50pm local (MDT).

On that count, Harper-Ellam did all he could by controlling both outings, but the consistency of Pinkerton ultimately won through as he maintained his 100% podium record this year.</p>\n\n<p>Harper-Ellam started his weekend in dominant fashion, securing pole position in the tricky damp qualifying session to ensure he will complete 2018 with a 100% qualifying record, before leading every lap of the opener.</p>\n\n<p>Title rival Pinkerton lined up second, with Shane Stoney leading row two from Dean Warriner. However, with a dry line emerging, tyre choice became a crucial factor. Both front row starters opted for dry Hankooks, as did Stoney, while Warriner took the softer wets. It all went wrong for Stoney from the start, when he stalled on the green flag lap and had to start last.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As Harper-Ellam bolted away, Warriner’s wets gripped better and he displaced Pinkerton for second into Paddock Hill Bend. That set up a brilliant tussle between the defending Warriner, Pinkerton and the recovering Stoney, who took just three laps to make it back into the top four. However, his progress was stunted when he copped a 10-second penalty for an out of position start as he attempted to retake his original grid slot on the green flag lap.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the censure, Stoney persisted and soon latched onto the fight for second. Things were shaken up when both Warriner and Pinkerton were delayed by a backmarker into Paddock. Pinkerton was worst affected and lost ground to the charging Stoney, who then accidentally clipped the back of Warriner at Druids, forcing bodywork to rub on his rear tyre. All three cars continued and Warriner defended hard until Stoney found a way past at Graham Hill Bend.</p>\n\n<p>However, with Stoney carrying that extra 10 seconds, he was demoted to an eventual fourth as Harper-Ellam took a crushing win from the promoted Warriner and Pinkerton.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The result meant Harper-Ellam closed the points gap to Pinkerton to 30, with 41 still on offer.</p>\n\n<p>The deciding race was a more straightforward event. The threat of rain abated and the field was greeted with a bone dry, but chilly, final dash.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Harper-Ellam’s second-fastest time kept him on pole, with Stoney alongside and Pinkerton right behind. Yet again, Harper-Ellam bolted as soon as the lights went out and pulled a sizable gap to Stoney in the early laps.</p>\n\n<p>Pinkerton meanwhile, well aware that just a top-10 would make him champion, kept a watching brief in third. The order was threatened when both Julian Lay and Warriner tangled at McLaren, summoning the safety car.</p>\n\n<p>However, Harper-Ellam judged the restart to perfection and was untouchable on his way to an eighth win of the year, ahead of Stoney and an emotional Pinkerton – the new champion thanking his Avidity Motorsport team from the podium.</p>\n\n<p>Mackenzie Walker capped an impressive debut SR1 weekend with fourth ahead of new Rookie Cup champion William Hunt, who recovered from a tough first outing to beat Rookie rival Chris Short to the laurels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Warriner recovered to seventh, ahead of Gavin McAlpine and Motor Sport magazine's Lyndon McNeil, who acquitted himself brilliantly in his first ever race weekend to score an impressive ninth place.</p>\n\n<p>David Tagg recovered from an early spin to score the season’s final Fangio Trophy win in 10th, and with it secured the class honours ahead of Paul Clark.</p>\n\n<p>Driver quotes:</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Harper-Ellam, double race winner, second in championship: “It’s been an amazing year, and to score another perfect weekend here is just brilliant. It’s obviously a shame to lose the overall championship, but I can’t grumble with eight race wins in my first year of Radical racing. Well done to James, he’s raced brilliantly all year. We’ve raced hard and we’ve raced fair. What a brilliant season.”</p>\n\n<p>James Pinkerton, two third places, champion: “It’s just so surreal. To hear the word champion associated with me… I only sat in a race car a year ago and now… it’s just… I’m so happy! It’s been a long and a hard year and Ryan has been an incredible rival all season. I knew what I had to do so took things cautiously in race one, but in race two I was driving around just thinking about the numbers, so there was definitely more pace on the table, but I was probably a bit scared of going for it. But what a year! I definitely plan to stay with Radical racing next season.”</p>\n\n<p>William Hunt, eighth and fifth, Rookie Cup champion: “I struggled a bit this weekend as it’s the first time I’ve raced here and the changing conditions made it quite tough to find the car’s limits, but it all came together in race two. I knew I had a decent points lead and saw Chris catching me in the last race, but I kept my head and stuck to my lines and just got to the flag first. To win the Rookie title is brilliant. It was my aim from the start of the year. I definitely want to be back and go for the overall next season.”</p>\n\n<p>David Tagg, 13th and 10th, Fangio Trophy champion: “It’s fantastic to have won the class title, especially after such a hard race. I spun early on and had to recover from there and managed to get back past Paul and get the job done. I’d have to say to anybody looking to get involved just to do it. It’s been a brilliant year and I’d love to come back next season.”</p>"

The new ASR Radical Edition chassis was displayed at Spring Mountain Motor Resort, just outside Las Vegas, Nevada for the four-day World Finals event for the first time, and promises to be the most robust prototype-style sim racing chassis ever created. Combining feedback from real-world Radical Cup drivers and Advanced Sim Racing’s proven design, it will be available for orders in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>The unique flat face aluminium profile will allow customers to replicate their real-world race car setup, as the ASR Radical Edition is offered in the same powder coat colours as Radical offer on their race cars. On top of this, the Advanced Sim Racing team can replicate any livery design using UV print or vinyl wraps. Customers can also have their livery replicated in the virtual world on their digital Radical, ready to race.</p>\n\n<p><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/876/original/SR10_-_Sim_November_11_2C_2022_13.jpg?1669913926 2x, https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/876/std/SR10_-_Sim_November_11_2C_2022_13.jpg?1669913926\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://orbit.brightbox.com/v1/acc-jqzwj/Radical-Cars/asset_management/assets/assets/000/002/876/std/SR10_-_Sim_November_11_2C_2022_13.jpg?1669913926\"></p>\n\n<p>Founded in 2020, Advanced SimRacing is the fastest-growing North American racing simulation chassis manufacturer. Owned and operated by passionate sim racers, the company designs and builds the sturdiest and most durable aluminium profile racing simulation cockpits available in the market today.</p>\n\n<p>Nikolas Dubois, Advanced Sim Racing COO and Co-Founder, said of the chassis “This is, without a shadow of doubt, the most robust sim racing chassis ever created. Thanks to our unique design and top-grade North American aluminium alloy, you can rest assured that this chassis will bring out the true potential of the most powerful sim racing peripherals available today. We’re delighted to partner with Radical Motorsport, having supported the Radical Cup North America series in the 2022 season and invited to join the celebrations at the Radical World Finals in Las Vegas.”</p>\n\n<p>The new co-branded products from Radical and Advanced SimRacing demonstrates Radical’s commitment to the world of virtual motorsport, having launched the SR3 XX back in 2020 simultaneously in the real-world and virtually in rFactor2 with Studio 397, and earlier this year introduced the SR10 into iRacing.</p>\n\n<p>Jon Roach, Radical Motorsport’s Global Head of Marketing, added “over the past two years we’ve noticed a large and growing community of virtual Radical racers, and with the launch of the SR10 in iRacing earlier this year we realised that a lot of our current ‘real-world’ Radical owners are also taking advantage of sim racing as a training and preparation tool for the various Radical Cup series around the world. This partnership with Advanced Sim Racing will allow us to offer a tailored solution for both fans and Radical owners around the world.“</p>\n\n<p>Sébastien Mailhot, President and Chief Executive Officer of D-BOX Technologies Inc added “D-BOX is proud to be collaborating with Advanced SimRacing and Radical Motorsport on this unique project. By combining our FIA-licensed haptic technology with ASR’s &amp; Radical's industry expertise, we are able to create an experience that goes above and beyond what a traditional simulator without motion can bring, which provides drivers with extremely realistic feedback, without having to be behind the wheel of a real car.\"</p>\n\n<p>The ASR Radical Edition chassis will be available from early 2023 as a standalone chassis for $1,895 USD and later as part of a complete Radical Simulator package including installation, driver fitting, training and support starting at $19,995 USD. Prices subject to change.</p>\n\n<h3>NOTES TO EDITORS</h3>\n\n<h3>Radical Motorsport</h3>\n\n<p>Radical Motorsport has enjoyed unprecedented growth as it heads into its 25th year, building and selling more cars in 2021 than at any other time in its history.
